              joint level perspective",
  author   = "Farris, D J and Sawicki, G S",
  abstract = "Humans walk and run at a range of speeds. While steady locomotion
              at a given speed requires no net mechanical work, moving faster
              does demand both more positive and negative mechanical work per
              stride. Is this increased demand met by increasing power output
              at all lower limb joints or just some of them? Does running rely
              on different joints for power output than walking? How does this
              contribute to the metabolic cost of locomotion? This study
              examined the effects of walking and running speed on lower limb
              joint mechanics and metabolic cost of transport in humans.
              Kinematic and kinetic data for 10 participants were collected for
              a range of walking (0.75, 1.25, 1.75, 2.0 m s(-1)) and running
              (2.0, 2.25, 2.75, 3.25 m s(-1)) speeds. Net metabolic power was
              measured by indirect calorimetry. Within each gait, there was no
              difference in the proportion of power contributed by each joint
              (hip, knee, ankle) to total power across speeds. Changing from
              walking to running resulted in a significant (p = 0.02) shift in
              power production from the hip to the ankle which may explain the
              higher efficiency of running at speeds above 2.0 m s(-1) and shed
              light on a potential mechanism behind the walk-run transition.",

  abstract = "Heel strike instants are an important component of gait analyses,
              yet accurate detection can be difficult without a force plate.
              This paper presents two novel techniques for kinematic heel
              strike instant (kHSI) detection which examined maximal resultant
              horizontal heel displacement (HHD). Each of these HHD techniques
              calculates HHD from a selected reference location of either the
              stance ankle or stance heel to the swing heel. The proposed
              techniques, along with other previously established techniques,
              were validated against a 10N force plate threshold. Fifty-four
              healthy adults walked overground at both normal and fast speeds
              while wearing athletic shoes. The reported true and absolute

              across 8678kHSI when using the stance ankle as a reference, which
              significantly outperformed (p<0.0001) the established techniques.
              Gait speed was shown to have a significant effect (p<0.0001) on

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Gait impairments during real-world locomotion are
              common in neurological diseases. However, very little is
              currently known about the neural correlates of walking in the
              real world and on which regions of the brain are involved in
              regulating gait stability and performance. As a first step to
              understanding how neural control of gait may be impaired in
              neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease, we
              investigated how regional brain activation might predict walking
              performance in the urban environment and whilst engaging with
              secondary tasks in healthy subjects. METHODS: We recorded gait
              characteristics including trunk acceleration and brain activation
              in 14 healthy young subjects whilst they walked around the
              university campus freely (single task), while conversing with the
              experimenter and while texting with their smartphone. Neural
              spectral power density (PSD) was evaluated in three brain regions
              of interest, namely the pre-frontal cortex (PFC) and bilateral
              posterior parietal cortex (right/left PPC). We hypothesized that
              specific regional neural activation would predict trunk
              acceleration data obtained during the different walking
              conditions. RESULTS: Vertical trunk acceleration was predicted by
              gait velocity and left PPC theta (4-7 Hz) band PSD in single-task
              walking (R-squared = 0.725, p = 0.001) and by gait velocity and
              left PPC alpha (8-12 Hz) band PSD in walking while conversing
              (R-squared = 0.727, p = 0.001). Medio-lateral trunk acceleration
              was predicted by left PPC beta (15-25 Hz) band PSD when walking
              while texting (R-squared = 0.434, p = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: We
              suggest that the left PPC may be involved in the processes of
              sensorimotor integration and gait control during walking in
              real-world conditions. Frequency-specific coding was operative in
              different dual tasks and may be developed as biomarkers of gait
              deficits in neurological conditions during performance of these
              types of, now commonly undertaken, dual tasks.",

              electrode approach to remove motion artifact from

              phantom human head model and robotic motion platform to induce
              motion while collecting scalp EEG. We assembled a dual electrode
              array capturing (a) artificial neural signals plus noise from
              scalp EEG electrodes, and (b) electrically isolated motion
              artifact noise. We recorded artificial neural signals broadcast
              from antennae in the phantom head during continuous vertical
              sinusoidal movements (stationary, 1.00, 1.25, 1.50, 1.75, 2.00 Hz

              signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), cross-correlation, and root mean
              square error (RMSE) between the ground truth broadcast signals
              and the recovered EEG signals. MAIN RESULTS: Signal quality was
              restored following noise cancellation when compared to single
              electrode EEG measurements collected with no phantom head motion.
              SIGNIFICANCE: We achieved substantial motion artifact attenuation
              using secondary electrodes for noise cancellation. These methods
              can be applied to studying electrocortical signals during human

  title    = "Interlimb differences in coordination of unsupported reaching
              movements",
  author   = "Schaffer, J E and Sainburg, R L",
  abstract = "Previous research suggests that interlimb differences in
              coordination associated with handedness might result from
              specialized control mechanisms that are subserved by different
              cerebral hemispheres. Based largely on the results of horizontal
              plane reaching studies, we have proposed that the hemisphere
              contralateral to the dominant arm is specialized for predictive
              control of limb dynamics, while the non-dominant hemisphere is
              specialized for controlling limb impedance. The current study
              explores interlimb differences in control of 3-D unsupported
              reaching movements. While the task was presented in the
              horizontal plane, participant's arms were unsupported and free to
              move within a range of the vertical axis, which was redundant to
              the task plane. Results indicated significant dominant arm
              advantages for both initial direction accuracy and final position
              accuracy. The dominant arm showed greater excursion along a
              redundant axis that was perpendicular to the task, and parallel
              to gravitational forces. In contrast, the non-dominant arm better
              impeded motion out of the task-plane. Nevertheless, non-dominant
              arm task errors varied substantially more with shoulder rotation
              excursion than did dominant arm task errors. These findings
              suggest that the dominant arm controller was able to take
              advantage of the redundant degrees of freedom of the task, while
              non-dominant task errors appeared enslaved to motion along the
              redundant axis. These findings are consistent with a dominant
              controller that is specialized for intersegmental coordination,
              and a non-dominant controller that is specialized for impedance
              control. However, the findings are inconsistent with previously
              documented conclusions from planar tasks, in which non-dominant
              control leads to greater final position accuracy.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Electroencephalography (EEG) can assess brain activity
              during whole-body motion in humans but head motion can induce
              artifacts that obfuscate electrocortical signals. Definitive
              solutions for removing motion artifact from EEG have yet to be
              found, so creating methods to assess signal processing routines
              for removing motion artifact are needed. We present a novel
              method for investigating the influence of head motion on EEG
              recordings as well as for assessing the efficacy of signal
              processing approaches intended to remove motion artifact.
              APPROACH: We used a phantom head device to mimic electrical
              properties of the human head with three controlled dipolar
              sources of electrical activity embedded in the phantom. We
              induced sinusoidal vertical motions on the phantom head using a
              custom-built platform and recorded EEG signals with three
              different acquisition systems while the head was both stationary
              and in varied motion conditions. MAIN RESULTS: Recordings showed
              up to 80\% reductions in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and up to
              3600\% increases in the power spectrum as a function of motion
              amplitude and frequency. Independent component analysis (ICA)
              successfully isolated the three dipolar sources across all
              conditions and systems. There was a high correlation (r > 0.85)
              and marginal increase in the independent components' (ICs) power
              spectrum ( approximately 15\%) when comparing stationary and
              motion parameters. The SNR of the IC activation was 400\%-700\%
              higher in comparison to the channel data SNR, attenuating the
              effects of motion on SNR. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that
              the phantom head and motion platform can be used to assess motion
              artifact removal algorithms and compare different EEG systems for
              motion artifact sensitivity. In addition, ICA is effective in
              isolating target electrocortical events and marginally improving
              SNR in relation to stationary recordings.",

              would be diminished in the patients compared to age-matched
              controls. The patients with history of cortical stroke, and
              age-matched controls (n=12 in each group) performed one-finger
              and multi-finger accurate force production tasks involving both
              steady-state and quick force pulse production. Finger
              interdependence (enslaving) and multi-finger synergies
              stabilizing total force were quantified. The stroke patients
              showed lower maximal finger forces, in particular in the
              contralesional hand, which also showed increased enslaving
              indices. Multi-finger synergies during steady-state force

              that mild cortical stroke leads to no significant changes in
              multifinger synergies, but there is impairment in feed-forward
              adjustments of the synergies prior to a quick action, a drop in
              the maximal force production, and an increase in enslaving. We

              electrocortical activity is coupled to gait cycle phase during
              steady-speed human walking. We used electroencephalography (EEG),
              motion capture, and a force-measuring treadmill to record brain
              and body dynamics while eight healthy young adult subjects walked
              on a treadmill. Infomax independent component analysis (ICA)
              parsed EEG signals into maximally independent component (IC)
              processes representing electrocortical sources, muscle sources,
              and artifacts. We calculated a spatially fixed equivalent current
              dipole for each IC using an inverse modeling approach, and
              clustered electrocortical sources across subjects by similarities
              in dipole locations and power spectra. We then computed
              spectrograms for each electrocortical source that were
              time-locked to the gait cycle. Electrocortical sources in the
              anterior cingulate, posterior parietal, and sensorimotor cortex
              exhibited significant (p<0.05) intra-stride changes in spectral
              power. During the end of stance, as the leading foot was
              contacting the ground and the trailing foot was pushing off,
              alpha- and beta-band spectral power increased in or near the
              left/right sensorimotor and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex.
              Power increases in the left/right sensorimotor cortex were more
              pronounced for contralateral limb push-off (ipsilateral
              heel-strike) than for ipsilateral limb push-off (contralateral
              heel-strike). Intra-stride high-gamma spectral power changes were
              evident in anterior cingulate, posterior parietal, and
              sensorimotor cortex. These data confirm cortical involvement in
              steady-speed human locomotion. Future applications of these
              techniques could provide critical insight into the neural
              mechanisms of movement disorders and gait rehabilitation.",

              actions, most studies of human brain dynamics examine subjects in
              static seated or prone conditions. EEG signals have historically
              been considered to be too noise prone to allow recording of brain
              dynamics during human locomotion. Here we applied a channel-based
              artifact template regression procedure and a subsequent spatial
              filtering approach to remove gait-related movement artifact from
              EEG signals recorded during walking and running. We first used
              stride time warping to remove gait artifact from high-density EEG
              recorded during a visual oddball discrimination task performed
              while walking and running. Next, we applied infomax independent
              component analysis (ICA) to parse the channel-based noise reduced
              EEG signals into maximally independent components (ICs) and then
              performed component-based template regression. Applying
              channel-based or channel-based plus component-based artifact
              rejection significantly reduced EEG spectral power in the 1.5- to
              8.5-Hz frequency range during walking and running. In walking
              conditions, gait-related artifact was insubstantial:
              event-related potentials (ERPs), which were nearly identical to
              visual oddball discrimination events while standing, were visible
              before and after applying noise reduction. In the running
              condition, gait-related artifact severely compromised the EEG
              signals: stable average ERP time-courses of IC processes were
              only detectable after artifact removal. These findings show that
              high-density EEG can be used to study brain dynamics during whole
              body movements and that mechanical artifact from rhythmic gait
              events may be minimized using a template regression procedure.",

              solution to noninvasively investigate cortical activities with

              of these methods is hindered by the fact that they have not been

              performances of several source localization methods (moving
              dipoles, minimum Lp norm, and low resolution tomography (LRT)
              with Lp norm, p equal to 1, 1.5, and 2) were evaluated by using

              (SEPs), and upper limb motor-related potentials (MRPs) obtained
              on human subjects (all with 163 scalp electrodes). By using
              simulated EEG data, we first evaluated the source localization
              ability of the above methods quantitatively. Subsequently, the

              localization ability than any of the other investigated methods
              and provides physiologically meaningful reconstruction results.

  abstract = "Holes in the skull may have a large influence on the EEG and ERP.
              Inverse source modeling techniques such as dipole fitting require
              an accurate volume conductor model. This model should incorporate
              holes if present, especially when either a neuronal generator or
              the electrodes are close to the hole, e.g., in case of a trephine
              hole in the upper part of the skull. The boundary element method
              (BEM) is at present the preferred method for inverse computations
              using a realistic head model, because of its efficiency and
              availability. Using a simulation approach, we have studied the
              accuracy of the BEM by comparing it to the analytical solution
              for a volume conductor without a hole, and to the finite
              difference method (FDM) for one with a hole. Furthermore, we have
              evaluated the influence of holes on the results of forward and
              inverse computations using the BEM. Without a hole and compared
              to the analytical model, a three-sphere BEM model was accurate up
              to 5-10\%, while the corresponding FDM model had an error <0.5\%.
              In the presence of a hole, the difference between the BEM and the
              FDM was, on average, 4\% (1.3-11.4\%). The FDM turned out to be
              very accurate if no hole is present. We believe that the
              difference between the BEM and the FDM represents the inaccuracy
              of the BEM. This inaccuracy in the BEM is very small compared to
              the effect that holes can have on the scalp potential (up to
              450\%). In regard to the large influence of holes on forward and
              inverse computations, we conclude that holes in the skull can be
              treated reliably by means of the BEM and should be incorporated
              in forward and inverse modeling.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Developing rehabilitation strategies to improve
              functional walking and postural control in patients is a priority
              for rehabilitation clinicians and researchers alike. One possible
              strategy is the use of sensory modalities to elicit adaptive
              locomotor gait patterns. This study aimed to explore to what
              extent haptic inputs, in the form of forward-leading tensile
              forces delivered to the hand, compared to no force, may lead to
              adaptation and post-adaptation effects on gait parameters, during
              and after the haptic exposure, respectively. METHODS: Thirteen
              healthy young individuals were recruited for this study. We
              developed an innovative system combining virtual reality and
              haptic tensile forces in the direction of locomotion to simulate
              walking with a dog. A robotic arm generated forces via an adapted
              leash to the participant's hand while they walked on a self-paced
              treadmill immersed in a virtual environment with scene
              progression synchronized to the treadmill. RESULTS: All
              participants showed significant increases in instantaneous gait
              velocity and stride length, with accompanying decreases in
              double-limb support time (p < 0.05) when walking with a haptic
              tensile force of either 10 or 20 N, relative to pre-force epoch
              levels, indicating an adaptation effect. When the 10 or 20 N
              force was removed, gait measures generally remained changed
              relative to baseline pre-force levels (p < 0.05), providing
              evidence of a post-adaptation effect. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in
              spatiotemporal outcomes provide evidence that both adaptation and
              post-adaptation effects were present in response to the
              application and removal of a haptic force. Future studies will
              investigate whether similar changes in elderly and post-stroke
              populations can be actualized during steady-state walking.",

              and leg movements are an intriguing issue in locomotor
              neuroscience. Amplitudes of early latency cutaneous reflexes
              (ELCRs) in stationary arm muscles are modulated during rhythmic
              leg or arm cycling but not during limb positioning or voluntary
              contraction. This suggests that interneurons mediating ELCRs to
              arm muscles integrate outputs from neural systems controlling
              rhythmic limb movements. Alternatively, outputs could be
              integrated at the motoneuron and/or supraspinal levels. We
              examined whether a separate effect on the ELCR pathways and
              cortico-motoneuronal excitability during arm and leg cycling is
              integrated by neural elements common to the lumbo-sacral and

              cycling (LEG), contralateral arm cycling (ARM), and simultaneous
              contralateral arm and bilateral leg cycling (A\&L), while ELCRs
              in the wrist flexor and shoulder flexor muscles were evoked by
              superficial radial (SR) nerve stimulation. ELCR amplitudes were

              during ARM and LEG. A low stimulus intensity during ARM or LEG
              generated a larger ELCR during A\&L than the sum of ELCRs during
              ARM and LEG. We confirmed this nonlinear increase in single motor
              unit firing probability following SR nerve stimulation during
              A\&L. Furthermore, motor-evoked potentials following transcranial
              magnetic and electrical stimulation did not show nonlinear
              potentiation during A\&L. These findings suggest the existence of
              a common neural element of the ELCR reflex pathway that is active

              displacement during automatic postural responses to support
              surface perturbations. METHODS: Individuals with PD (n = 26) were
              recruited for high-volume Adapted Tango (15 lessons, 1.5 hour
              each over 3 weeks). Twenty participants were assessed with
              clinical balance and gait measures before and after the
              intervention. Nine participants were also assessed with
              support-surface translation perturbations. RESULTS: Overall
              adherence to the intervention was 77\%. At posttest, peak forward
              CoM displacement was reduced (4.0 +/- 0.9 cm, pretest, vs 3.7 +/-
              1.1 cm, posttest; P = 0.03; Cohen's d = 0.30) and correlated to
              improvements on Berg Balance Scale (rho = -0.68; P = 0.04) and
              Dynamic Gait Index (rho = -0.75; P = 0.03). Overall antagonist
              onset time was delayed (27 ms; P = 0.02; d = 0.90) and duration
              was reduced (56 ms, approximately 39\%, P = 0.02; d = 0.45).
              Reductions in EMG magnitude were also observed (P < 0.05).
              DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Following participation in Adapted
              Tango, changes in kinematic and some EMG measures of perturbation
              responses were observed in addition to improvements in clinical
              measures. We conclude that 3-week, high-volume Adapted Tango is

  abstract = "Active and viewed limb movement activate many similar neural
              pathways, however, to date most comparison studies have focused
              on subjects making small, discrete movements of the hands and
              feet. The purpose of this study was to determine if high-density
              electroencephalography (EEG) could detect differences in cortical
              activity and connectivity during active and viewed rhythmic arm
              and leg movements in humans. Our primary hypothesis was that we
              would detect similar but weaker electrocortical spectral
              fluctuations and effective connectivity fluctuations during
              viewed limb exercise compared to active limb exercise due to the
              similarities in neural recruitment. A secondary hypothesis was
              that we would record stronger cortical spectral fluctuations for
              arm exercise compared to leg exercise, because rhythmic arm
              exercise would be more dependent on supraspinal control than
              rhythmic leg exercise. We recorded EEG data while ten young
              healthy subjects exercised on a recumbent stepper with: (1) both
              arms and legs, (2) just legs, and (3) just arms. Subjects also
              viewed video playback of themselves or another individual
              performing the same exercises. We performed independent component
              analysis, dipole fitting, spectral analysis, and effective
              connectivity analysis on the data. Cortical areas comprising the
              premotor and supplementary motor cortex, the anterior cingulate,
              the posterior cingulate, and the parietal cortex exhibited
              significant spectral fluctuations during rhythmic limb exercise.
              These fluctuations tended to be greater for the arms exercise
              conditions than for the legs only exercise condition, which
              suggests that human rhythmic arm movements are under stronger
              cortical control than rhythmic leg movements. We did not find
              consistent spectral fluctuations in these areas during the viewed
              conditions, but effective connectivity fluctuated at harmonics of
              the exercise frequency during both active and viewed rhythmic
              limb exercise. The right premotor and supplementary motor cortex
              drove the network. These results suggest that a similarly

  abstract = "Interlimb coordination is essential to perform goal-directed
              daily tasks and purposeful locomotion. The coordination occurs
              due to spatiotemporal coupling of movements, which also comprises
              interactions in segmental kinematics, joint dynamics, and muscle
              activity. Neuroanatomical and neurophysiological linkages at the
              spinal and brain level are responsible for the coordination. The
              linkage is termed ``neural coupling''. According to the task
              demand, the coupling may occur between two upper limbs or two
              lower limbs or all four limbs. Central pattern generators play a
              key role in interlimb coordination by regulating the rhythmic
              upper and lower limb movements. Neuroanatomically, multiple areas
              of both cerebral hemispheres via the corpus callosum interact and
              control the bimanual upper limb movements. There is an
              interhemispheric synchronization and disinhibition to control the
              coupled bimanual upper and lower limb movements. Movement of the
              upper limb also enhances neuromuscular recruitment of the lower
              limb. In stroke, bimanual motor impairments exist in the form of
              asymmetry and reduced coordination, which may be related to
              weakness of the ipsilateral body side lesser than the
              contralateral side. The aim of the present review was to
              understand the interlimb coordination and neural coupling and its
              implication in stroke rehabilitation. The review suggests
              incorporating the movements of bilateral upper and lower limbs
              either simultaneously or consecutively for hemiparetic subjects.

  abstract = "Muscle coordination may be difficult or impossible to predict
              accurately based on biomechanical considerations alone because of
              redundancy in the musculoskeletal system. Because many solutions
              exist for any given movement, the role of the nervous system in
              further constraining muscle coordination patterns for movement
              must be considered in both healthy and impaired motor control. On
              the basis of computational neuromechanical analyses of
              experimental data combined with modeling techniques, we have
              demonstrated several such neural constraints on the temporal and
              spatial patterns of muscle activity during both locomotion and
              postural responses to balance perturbations. We hypothesize that
              subject-specific and trial-by-trial differences in muscle
              activation can be parameterized and understood by a hierarchical
              and low-dimensional framework that reflects the neural control of
              task-level goals. In postural control, we demonstrate that
              temporal patterns of muscle activity may be governed by feedback
              control of task-level variables that represent the overall
              goal-directed motion of the body. These temporal patterns then
              recruit spatially-fixed patterns of muscle activity called muscle
              synergies that produce the desired task-level biomechanical
              functions that require multijoint coordination. Moreover, these
              principles apply more generally to movement, and in particular to
              locomotor tasks in both healthy and impaired individuals.
              Overall, understanding the goals and organization of the neural
              control of movement may provide useful reduced dimension
              parameter sets to address the degrees-of-freedom problem in
              musculoskeletal movement control. More importantly, however,
              neuromechanical analyses may lend insight and provide a framework
              for understanding subject-specific and trial-by-trial differences
              in movement across both healthy and motor-impaired populations.",

               understanding the neural mechanisms of upper-limb reaching
               control. This study specifically addressed how EEG dynamics in
               the time domain encoded finger movement directions (directional
               tuning) and posture dependence (movement reference frames) by
               applying representational similarity analysis. High-density EEG
               covering the entire scalp was recorded while participants
               performed eight-directional, center-out reaching movements,
               thereby allowing us to explore directional selectivity of EEG
               sources over the brain beyond somatosensory areas. A majority of
               the source processes exhibited statistically significant
               directional tuning during peri-movement periods. In addition,
               directional tuning curves shifted systematically when the
               shoulder angle was rotated to perform the task within a more
               laterally positioned workspace, the degree of tuning curve
               rotation falling between that predicted by models assuming
               extrinsic and shoulder-based reference frames. We conclude that
               temporal dynamics of neural mechanisms for motor control can be
               studied noninvasively in humans using high-density EEG and that
               directional sensitivity of motor and non-motor processing is not
               limited within the sensorimotor areas but extends to the whole
               brain areas.",

  abstract = "Characterizing locomotor dynamics is essential for understanding
              the neuromuscular control of locomotion. In particular,
              quantifying dynamic stability during walking is important for
              assessing people who have a greater risk of falling. However,
              traditional biomechanical methods of defining stability have not
              quantified the resistance of the neuromuscular system to
              perturbations, suggesting that more precise definitions are
              required. For the present study, average maximum finite-time
              Lyapunov exponents were estimated to quantify the local dynamic
              stability of human walking kinematics. Local scaling exponents,
              defined as the local slopes of the correlation sum curves, were
              also calculated to quantify the local scaling structure of each
              embedded time series. Comparisons were made between overground
              and motorized treadmill walking in young healthy subjects and
              between diabetic neuropathic (NP) patients and healthy controls
              (CO) during overground walking. A modification of the method of
              surrogate data was developed to examine the stochastic nature of
              the fluctuations overlying the nominally periodic patterns in
              these data sets. Results demonstrated that having subjects walk
              on a motorized treadmill artificially stabilized their natural
              locomotor kinematics by small but statistically significant
              amounts. Furthermore, a paradox previously present in the
              biomechanical literature that resulted from mistakenly equating
              variability with dynamic stability was resolved. By slowing their
              self-selected walking speeds, NP patients adopted more locally
              stable gait patterns, even though they simultaneously exhibited
              greater kinematic variability than CO subjects. Additionally, the
              loss of peripheral sensation in NP patients was associated with
              statistically significant differences in the local scaling
              structure of their walking kinematics at those length scales
              where it was anticipated that sensory feedback would play the
              greatest role. Lastly, stride-to-stride fluctuations in the
              walking patterns of all three subject groups were clearly
              distinguishable from linearly autocorrelated Gaussian noise. As a
              collateral benefit of the methodological approach taken in this
              study, some of the first steps at characterizing the underlying
              structure of human locomotor dynamics have been taken.

              maintain the stability of standing and walking should be quite
              different. However, many studies have shown that postural

              though most falls occur during locomotor tasks and not during
              postural tasks. This suggests that there is at least some
              commonality among the mechanisms governing the control of both
              standing and walking. The present study was conducted to
              determine whether the postural stability either is or is not
              directly related to locomotor stability. Twenty healthy adults,
              age 18-73 years, walked on a motorized treadmill at their
              preferred walking speed for three trials of 5 min. They also
              stood on a force plate for three trials of 5 min. Both tasks were
              performed without imposing any additional external perturbations.
              The motion of each subject's trunk segment was recorded and
              described using a multi-dimensional state space defined in the
              same manner for both tasks. Local dynamic stability was
              quantified from the mean divergence over time of locally
              perturbed trajectories in state space, which was parameterized as
              a double exponential process. Divergence parameters were compared

              parameters for standing, but not to those for walking. This study

              internal and external noise, inherent biological redundancy, and
              from the neurophysiological control actions that help regulate
              movement fluctuations. Increased walking variability can lead to
              increased energetic cost and/or increased fall risk. Conversely,
              biological noise may be beneficial, even necessary, to enhance
              motor performance. Indeed, encouraging more variability actually
              facilitates greater improvements in some forms of locomotor
              rehabilitation. Thus, it is critical to identify the fundamental
              principles humans use to regulate stride-to-stride fluctuations
              in walking. This study sought to determine how humans regulate
              stride-to-stride fluctuations in stepping movements during
              treadmill walking. We developed computational models based on
              pre-defined goal functions to compare if subjects, from each
              stride to the next, tried to maintain the same speed as the
              treadmill, or instead stay in the same position on the treadmill.
              Both strategies predicted average behaviors empirically
              indistinguishable from each other and from that of humans. These
              strategies, however, predicted very different stride-to-stride
              fluctuation dynamics. Comparisons to experimental data showed
              that human stepping movements were generally well-predicted by
              the speed-control model, but not by the position-control model.
              Human subjects also exhibited no indications they corrected
              deviations in absolute position only intermittently: i.e., closer
              to the boundaries of the treadmill. Thus, humans clearly do not
              adopt a control strategy whose primary goal is to maintain some
              constant absolute position on the treadmill. Instead, humans
              appear to regulate their stepping movements in a way most
              consistent with a strategy whose primary goal is to try to
              maintain the same speed as the treadmill at each consecutive
              stride. These findings have important implications both for
              understanding how biological systems regulate walking in general

              year. Perturbation-based gait training and the use of virtual
              environments have been shown independently to be effective at
              improving walking stability in patient populations. An
              intervention was developed combining the strengths of the 2
              paradigms utilizing continuous, walking surface angle
              oscillations within a virtual environment. This case report
              describes walking function and mediolateral stability outcomes of
              an individual with a unilateral transfemoral amputation following
              a novel perturbation-based gait training intervention in a
              virtual environment. CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient was a
              43-year-old male veteran who underwent a right transfemoral
              amputation 7+ years previously as a result of a traumatic blast
              injury. He used a microprocessor-controlled knee and an energy
              storage and return foot. OUTCOMES: Following the intervention,
              multiple measures indicated improved function and stability,
              including faster self-selected walking speed and reduced
              functional stepping time, mean step width, and step width
              variability. These changes were seen during normal level walking
              and mediolateral visual field or platform perturbations. In
              addition, benefits were retained at least 5 weeks after the final
              training session. DISCUSSION: The perturbation-based gait
              training program in the virtual environment resulted in the
              patient's improved walking function and mediolateral stability.
              Although the patient had completed intensive rehabilitation
              following injury and was fully independent, the intervention
              still induced notable improvements to mediolateral stability.
              Thus, perturbation-based gait training in challenging simulated

              Among many possible strategies available, healthy humans walking
              on motorized treadmills allow fluctuations in stride length (Ln)
              and stride time (Tn) to persist across multiple consecutive
              strides, but rapidly correct deviations in stride speed
              (Sn=Ln/Tn) at each successive stride, n. Several experiments
              verified this stepping strategy when participants walked with no
              optic flow. This study determined how removing or systematically
              altering optic flow influenced peoples' stride-to-stride stepping
              control strategies. Participants walked on a treadmill with a
              virtual reality (VR) scene projected onto a 3m tall, 180 degrees
              semi-cylindrical screen in front of the treadmill. Five
              conditions were tested: blank screen (``BLANK''), static scene
              (``STATIC''), or moving scene with optic flow speed slower than
              (``SLOW''), matched to (``MATCH''), or faster than (``FAST'')
              walking speed. Participants took shorter and faster strides and
              demonstrated increased stepping variability during the BLANK
              condition compared to the other conditions. Thus, when visual
              information was removed, individuals appeared to walk more
              cautiously. Optic flow influenced both how quickly humans
              corrected stride speed deviations and how successful they were at
              enacting this strategy to try to maintain approximately constant
              speed at each stride. These results were consistent with Weber's
              law: healthy adults more-rapidly corrected stride speed
              deviations in a no optic flow condition (the lower intensity
              stimuli) compared to contexts with non-zero optic flow. These

              the two motor skills, with consolidation occurring gradually over
              this period. Previous studies in humans and other primates have
              found this time-dependent disruption of consolidation only in
              explicit memory tasks, which rely on brain structures in the
              medial temporal lobe. Our results indicate that motor memories,
              which do not depend on the medial temporal lobe, can be
              transformed by a similar process of consolidation. By extending
              the phenomenon of consolidation to motor memory, our results
              indicate that distinct neural systems share similar
              characteristics when encoding and storing new information.",

              supply physical assistance to a patient's lower limbs to aid
              stepping. The expensive equipment and intensive manual labor
              required for these therapies limit their availability to
              patients. One alternative solution is to design devices where
              patients could use their upper limbs to provide physical
              assistance to their lower limbs (i.e., self-assistance). To
              explore potential neural effects of coupling upper and lower
              limbs, we investigated neuromuscular recruitment during
              self-driven and externally driven lower limb motion. Healthy
              subjects exercised on a recumbent stepper using different
              combinations of upper and lower limb exertions. The recumbent
              stepper mechanically coupled the upper and lower limbs, allowing
              users to drive the stepping motion with upper and/or lower limbs.
              We instructed subjects to step with 1) active upper and lower
              limbs at an easy resistance level (active arms and legs); 2)
              active upper limbs and relaxed lower limbs at easy, medium, and
              hard resistance levels (self-driven); and 3) relaxed upper and
              lower limbs while another person drove the stepping motion
              (externally driven). We recorded surface electromyography (EMG)
              from six lower limb muscles. Self-driven EMG amplitudes were
              always higher than externally driven EMG amplitudes (P < 0.05).
              As resistance and upper limb exertion increased, self-driven EMG
              amplitudes also increased. EMG bursts during self-driven and
              active arms and legs stepping occurred at similar times. These
              results indicate that active upper limb movement increases
              neuromuscular activation of the lower limbs during cyclic
              stepping motions. Neurologically impaired humans that actively

              assistance-as-needed",
  author   = "Emken, J L and Benitez, R and Reinkensmeyer, D J",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: A prevailing paradigm of physical rehabilitation
              following neurologic injury is to ``assist-as-needed'' in
              completing desired movements. Several research groups are
              attempting to automate this principle with robotic movement
              training devices and patient cooperative algorithms that
              encourage voluntary participation. These attempts are currently
              not based on computational models of motor learning. METHODS:
              Here we assume that motor recovery from a neurologic injury can
              be modelled as a process of learning a novel sensory motor
              transformation, which allows us to study a simplified
              experimental protocol amenable to mathematical description.
              Specifically, we use a robotic force field paradigm to impose a
              virtual impairment on the left leg of unimpaired subjects walking
              on a treadmill. We then derive an ``assist-as-needed'' robotic
              training algorithm to help subjects overcome the virtual
              impairment and walk normally. The problem is posed as an
              optimization of performance error and robotic assistance. The
              optimal robotic movement trainer becomes an error-based
              controller with a forgetting factor that bounds kinematic errors
              while systematically reducing its assistance when those errors
              are small. As humans have a natural range of movement
              variability, we introduce an error weighting function that causes
              the robotic trainer to disregard this variability. RESULTS: We
              experimentally validated the controller with ten unimpaired
              subjects by demonstrating how it helped the subjects learn the
              novel sensory motor transformation necessary to counteract the
              virtual impairment, while also preventing them from experiencing
              large kinematic errors. The addition of the error weighting
              function allowed the robot assistance to fade to zero even though
              the subjects' movements were variable. We also show that in order
              to assist-as-needed, the robot must relax its assistance at a
              rate faster than that of the learning human. CONCLUSION: The
              assist-as-needed algorithm proposed here can limit error during
              the learning of a dynamic motor task. The algorithm encourages
              learning by decreasing its assistance as a function of the
              ongoing progression of movement error. This type of algorithm is
              well suited for helping people learn dynamic tasks for which
              large kinematic errors are dangerous or discouraging, and thus
              may prove useful for robot-assisted movement training of walking
              or reaching following neurologic injury.",

              thought of as a process in which the nervous system learns to
              anticipate the environmental forces to eliminate kinematic error.
              Here we show that motor adaptation can more generally be modeled
              as a process in which the motor system greedily minimizes a cost
              function that is the weighted sum of kinematic error and effort.
              The learning dynamics predicted by this minimization process are
              a linear, auto-regressive equation with only one state, which has
              been identified previously as providing a good fit to data from
              force-field-type experiments. Thus we provide a new theoretical
              result that shows how these previously identified learning
              dynamics can be viewed as arising from an optimization of error
              and effort. We also show that the coefficients of the learning
              dynamics must fall within a specific range for the optimization
              model to be valid and verify with experimental data from walking
              in a force field that they indeed fall in this range. Finally, we
              attempted to falsify the model by performing experiments in two
              conditions (repeated exposure to a force field, exposure to force
              fields of different strengths) for which the single-state,
              auto-regressive equation might be expected to not fit the data
              well. We found however that the equation adequately captured the
              pattern of errors and thus conclude that motor adaptation to a

  abstract = "At present, rhythmic and discrete movements are investigated by
              largely distinct research communities using different
              experimental paradigms and theoretical constructs. As these two
              classes of movements are tightly interlinked in everyday
              behavior, a common theoretical foundation spanning across these
              two types of movements would be valuable. Furthermore, it has
              been argued that these two movement types may constitute
              primitives for more complex behavior. The goal of this paper is
              to develop a rigorous taxonomic foundation that not only permits
              better communication between different research communities, but
              also helps in defining movement types in experimental design and

              application of a smoothness measure to both types that enables
              quantification of discreteness and rhythmicity. Central to the
              definition of discrete movement is their separation by postures.
              Based on this intuitive definition, certain variants of rhythmic
              movement are indistinguishable from a sequence of discrete
              movements, reflecting an ongoing debate in the motor neuroscience

              body weight support (BWS), and recumbent stepping using a

              upper and lower limb electromyography patterns between conditions
              revealed high correlations for most muscles. A principal
              component analysis revealed that the first factor accounted for

              (81\%) than during walking (70\%). This indicates that the motor
              pattern during walking is more complex than during stepping.
              Cross correlation analysis found a high correlation between
              factors for recumbent stepping and walking (R = 0.54), though not

  abstract = "It has been proposed that different forms of rhythmic human limb
              movement have a common central neural control ('common core
              hypothesis'), just as in other animals. We compared the
              modulation patterns of background EMG and cutaneous reflexes
              during walking, arm and leg cycling, and arm-assisted recumbent
              stepping. We hypothesized that patterns of EMG and reflex
              modulation during cycling and stepping (deduced from mathematical
              principal components analysis) would be comparable to those
              during walking because they rely on similar neural substrates.
              Differences between the tasks were assessed by evoking cutaneous
              reflexes via stimulation of nerves in the foot and hand in
              separate trials. The EMG was recorded from flexor and extensor
              muscles of the arms and legs. Angular positions of the hip, knee
              and elbow joints were also recorded. Factor analysis revealed
              that across the three tasks, four principal components explained
              more than 93\% of the variance in the background EMG and
              middle-latency reflex amplitude. Phase modulation of reflex
              amplitude was observed in most muscles across all tasks,
              suggesting activity in similar control networks. Significant
              correlations between EMG level and reflex amplitude were
              frequently observed only during static voluntary muscle
              activation and not during rhythmic movement. Results from a

              reflex amplitudes was observed during discrete, voluntary leg
              extension but not during walking. There were task-dependent
              differences in reflex modulation between the three tasks which
              probably arise owing to specific constraints during each task.
              Overall, the results show strong correlation across tasks and

              pathways for modifying muscle activation patterns in terms of
              phasing is less clear. Here we studied adaptation of muscle
              activity phasing to the relative angular positions of limbs using
              a split-crank ergometer, where the cranks could be decoupled to
              allow different spatial angular position relationships. Twenty

              Sci. Sports Exerc., Vol. 41, No. 9, pp. 1778-1789, 2009. Purpose:
              There are neural connections between the upper and lower limbs of
              humans that enable muscle activation in one limb pair (upper or
              lower) to modulate muscle activation in the other limb pair
              (lower or upper, respectively). The aims of this study were to
              extend previous findings regarding submaximal exercise to maximal
              effort exercise and determine whether there is an ipsilateral or
              contralateral bias to the neural coupling during a rhythmic
              locomotor-like task. Methods: We measured upper and lower limb
              muscle activity, joint kinematics, and limb forces in
              neurologically intact subjects (n = 16) as they performed
              recumbent stepping using different combinations of upper and
              lower limb efforts. Results: We found increased muscle activation
              in passive lower limbs during active upper limb effort compared
              with passive upper limb effort. Likewise, increased muscle
              activation in passive upper limbs occurred during active lower
              limb effort compared with passive lower limb effort, suggesting a
              bidirectional effect. Maximal muscle activation in the active
              lower limbs was not different between conditions with active
              upper limb effort and conditions with passive upper limb
              movement. Similarly, maximal muscle activation in the active
              upper limbs was not different between conditions with active
              lower limb effort and conditions with passive lower limb
              movement. Further comparisons revealed that neural coupling was
              primarily from active upper limb muscles to passive ipsilateral
              lower limb muscles. Conclusions: These findings indicate that
              interlimb neural coupling affects muscle recruitment during
              maximal effort upper and lower limb rhythmic exercise and
              provides insight into the architecture of the neural coupling.",

              current knowledge of the natural history of arm recovery after
              stroke and of outcome prediction in individual patients.
              Rehabilitation strategies and outcome measures for impairment

              and time of rehabilitation are then discussed. Robots are

              rhythmic movement of the arms has also been shown to enhance and
              shape muscle activity in the legs. However, restricted
              information is available concerning the conditions necessary to
              maximally alter lumbar spinal cord excitability. Knowledge on the
              neuromechanics of a task can assist in the determination of the
              type, level, and timing of neural signals, yet arm swing during
              walking and arm cycling have not received a detailed
              neuromechanical comparison. The purpose of this research was to
              provide a combined neural and mechanical measurement approach
              that could be used to assist in the determination of the
              necessary and sufficient conditions for arm movement to assist in
              lower limb rehabilitation after stroke and spinal cord injury.
              Subjects performed three rhythmic arm movement tasks: (1) cycling
              (cycle); (2) swinging while standing (swing); and (3) swinging
              while treadmill walking (walk). We hypothesized that any
              difference in neural control between tasks (i.e., pattern of
              muscle activity) would reflect changes in the mechanical
              constraints unique to each task. Three-dimensional kinematics
              were collected simultaneously with force measurement at the hand
              and electromyography from the arms and trunk. All data were
              appropriately segmented to allow a comparison between and across
              conditions and were normalized and averaged to 100\% movement
              cycle based on shoulder excursion. Separate mathematical
              principal components analysis of kinematic and neural variables
              was performed to determine common task features and muscle
              synergies. The results highlight important neural and mechanical
              features that distinguish differences between tasks. For example,
              there are considerable differences in the anatomical positions of
              the arms during each task, which relate to the moments
              experienced about the elbow and shoulder. Also, there are
              differences between tasks in elbow flexion/extension kinematics
              alongside differential muscle activation profiles. As well,
              mechanical assistance and constraints during all tasks could
              affect muscle recruitment and the functional role of muscles.
              Overall, despite neural and mechanical differences, the results
              are consistent with conserved common central motor control
              mechanisms operational for cycle, walk, and swing but
              appropriately sculpted to demands unique to each task. However,
              changing the mechanical parameters could affect the role of

              Muscle coordination deficits, in the form of inappropriately
              phased muscle activity patterns, are well recognized in both the
              paretic and non-paretic limbs of stroke survivors. Our recent
              work demonstrated that muscle phasing can be systematically
              influenced by changing the relative angular positions of limbs in
              both neurologically intact individuals and people post-stroke.
              However, it is still unknown whether the observed transient
              changes in adjusted muscle phasing can be adapted following a
              short-bout of training on the split-crank ergometer. To explore
              the extent to which the non-paretic and paretic limbs of people
              with stroke can adapt to new muscle activity phasing changes, we
              examined the adaptation of muscle phasing following a short-bout
              of pedaling training at two specific relative spatial angular
              positions of limbs that had caused the greatest phasing changes

              stroke and twelve age- and gender-matched control subjects
              participated in this study. We demonstrated that both intact and
              cerebrally impaired nervous systems are capable of adapting new
              muscle phasing patterns and producing aftereffects that persisted
              for at least 10 min. However, we observed a completely different
              trend of aftereffects in post-stroke subjects compared with
              controls. Specifically, in controls, the aftereffects were
              observed only in the leg that was in the following position
              during the adaptation training whereas in post-stroke subjects,
              aftereffects were observed only in the leg that acted as the
              leading leg during adaptation, regardless of the limb being
              paretic or non-paretic. These findings suggest that adapting a
              new muscle activity pattern during a bilateral locomotor task

              of inappropriately phased muscle-activity patterns, occur in both
              the paretic and nonparetic limbs. These dysfunctional paretic
              muscle-coordination patterns can adapt to somatosensory inputs,

              extremity muscles (vastus medialis, rectus femoris, tibialis
              anterior, and soleus). During each experiment, the relative
              angular crank positions were manipulated by increasing or

              degrees over the complete cycle [0 degrees (in phase pedaling),

              We found that the paretic and nonparetic muscle phasing in the
              cycle systematically adapted to varied relative angular
              relationships, and this systematic relationship was well modeled
              by a sinusoidal relationship. Also, the paretic uniarticular
              muscle (vastus medialis) showed larger phase shifts compared with
              biarticular muscle (rectus femoris). More importantly, for each
              stroke subject, we demonstrated an exclusive crank-angular
              relation that resulted in the generation of more appropriately

              on a recumbent stepping machine both with and without arm
              movements. Activity of five leg muscles was recorded and compared

              arm movements are optimal for leg muscle facilitation, subjects
              were instructed to step with 1) mechanically coupled vs.
              decoupled arm and leg movements, 2) synchronous vs. asynchronous
              arm movements, and 3) at 50 vs. 70 RPM. Leg muscle activity was
              increased by active arm movements in all muscles, except the
              vastus lateralis muscle. Activity of other extensors (soleus,
              medial gastrocnemius, and biceps femoris) was primarily increased
              during the extension phase, whereas activity of flexors (tibialis

              Facilitation was more or less consistent for both frequencies and
              for synchronous and asynchronous movements. For coupled arm
              movements, facilitation tended to be diminished or absent. The
              observed facilitation in the present study is probably of
              neuromuscular rather than biomechanical origin, since the arms
              are probably hardly involved in postural control or
              weight-bearing during recumbent stepping. Further studies in

              participants with chronic hemiparesis were trained with haptic
              (via robot-rendered forces) and graphic (via a virtual
              environment) distortions to amplify upper-extremity (UE) tracking
              error. In a randomized crossover design, the intervention was
              compared with an equivalent amount of practice without error
              augmentation (EA). Interventions involved three 45-minute
              sessions per week for 2 weeks, then 1 week of no treatment, and
              then 2 additional weeks of the alternate treatment. A therapist
              provided a visual cursor using a tracking device, and
              participants were instructed to match it with their hand. Haptic
              and visual EA was used with blinding of participant, therapist,
              technician-operator, and evaluator. Clinical measures of

  abstract = "The ability to learn new movements and dynamics is important for
              maintaining independence with advancing age. Age-related
              sensorimotor changes and increased muscle coactivation likely
              alter the trial-and-error-based process of adapting to new
              movement demands (motor adaptation). Here, we asked, to what
              extent is motor adaptation to novel dynamics maintained in older
              adults (>/=65 yr)? We hypothesized that older adults would adapt
              to the novel dynamics less well than young adults. Because older
              adults often use muscle coactivation, we expected older adults to
              use greater muscle coactivation during motor adaptation than
              young adults. Nevertheless, we predicted that older adults would
              reduce muscle activity and metabolic cost with motor adaptation,
              similar to young adults. Seated older (n = 11, 73.8 +/- 5.6 yr)
              and young (n = 15, 23.8 +/- 4.7 yr) adults made targeted reaching
              movements while grasping a robotic arm. We measured their
              metabolic rate continuously via expired gas analysis. A force
              field was used to add novel dynamics. Older adults had greater
              movement deviations and compensated for just 65\% of the novel
              dynamics compared with 84\% in young adults. As expected, older
              adults used greater muscle coactivation than young adults. Last,
              older adults reduced muscle activity with motor adaptation and
              had consistent reductions in metabolic cost later during motor
              adaptation, similar to young adults. These results suggest that
              despite increased muscle coactivation, older adults can adapt to
              the novel dynamics, albeit less accurately. These results also
              suggest that reductions in metabolic cost may be a fundamental

              variety of objects in various conditions on a daily basis.
              Evidence suggests that motor adaptation relies on a process that
              minimizes error and effort; however, much of this evidence
              involved adapting to novel dynamics with physical perturbations
              to counteract. To examine the generality of the process of
              minimizing error and effort during motor adaptation, we used a
              visuomotor adaptation task that did not involve dynamic
              perturbations. We investigated the time courses of muscle
              activity, coactivation, and metabolic cost as subjects reached to
              a target with a visuomotor rotation. We wanted to determine
              whether subjects would modulate muscle activity, coactivation,
              and metabolic cost during a visuomotor adaptation task.
              Interestingly, subjects increased muscle coactivation early
              during visuomotor adaptation when there were large
              cursor-trajectory errors but no physical perturbations to reject.
              As adaptation progressed, muscle activity and coactivation
              decreased. Metabolic cost followed a similar time course. When
              the perturbation was removed, typical after-effects were
              observed: trajectory error increased and then was reduced
              quickly. This was accompanied by increases in muscle activity,
              coactivation, and metabolic cost, along with subsequent rapid
              reductions. These results demonstrate that subjects modulate
              muscle activity, coactivation, and metabolic cost similarly
              across different forms of motor adaptation. Overall, our findings

              considered automatic, such that any perturbations are corrected

              correction of upper limb (e.g., finger tapping) and lower limb
              (e.g., stepping) movements to a phase perturbed auditory beat
              usually results in individuals being back in phase after just a
              few beats. When a metronome is presented in more than one sensory
              modality, a multisensory advantage is observed, with reduced
              temporal variability in finger tapping movements compared to
              unimodal conditions. Here, we investigate synchronization of
              lower limb movements (stepping in place) to auditory, visual and
              combined auditory-visual (AV) metronome cues. In addition, we
              compare movement corrections to phase advance and phase delay
              perturbations in the metronome for the three sensory modality
              conditions. We hypothesized that, as with upper limb movements,
              there would be a multisensory advantage, with stepping
              variability being lowest in the bimodal condition. As such, we
              further expected correction to the phase perturbation to be
              quickest in the bimodal condition. Our results revealed lower
              variability in the asynchronies between foot strikes and the
              metronome beats in the bimodal condition, compared to unimodal
              conditions. However, while participants corrected substantially
              quicker to perturbations in auditory compared to visual
              metronomes, there was no multisensory advantage in the phase
              correction task-correction under the bimodal condition was almost
              identical to the auditory-only (AO) condition. On the whole, we
              noted that corrections in the stepping task were smaller than
              those previously reported for finger tapping studies. We conclude
              that temporal corrections are not only affected by the

              became relatively skilled at putting to a near and far target by
              first practicing without force fields. On day 2, they warmed up
              at the task without force fields, then practiced with force
              fields that either reduced or augmented their kinematic errors

              quantified motor skill as the variability in impact velocity at

              motivational effects persisted on day 3 in a way that was
              uncorrelated with actual skill. In summary, robotically reducing

              putting skill more for less skilled putters. Robotically

              intentionally varying the motor commands in search of actions
              that yield the greatest success. Here, we investigated the role
              of the human basal ganglia in controlling reward-dependent motor
              variability as measured by trial-to-trial changes in performance
              during a reaching task. We designed an experiment in which the
              only performance feedback was success or failure and quantified
              how reach variability was modulated as a function of the
              probability of reward. In healthy controls, reach variability
              increased as the probability of reward decreased. Control of
              variability depended on the history of past rewards, with the
              largest trial-to-trial changes occurring immediately after an
              unrewarded trial. In contrast, in participants with Parkinson's
              disease, a known example of basal ganglia dysfunction, reward was
              a poor modulator of variability; that is, the patients showed an
              impaired ability to increase variability in response to decreases
              in the probability of reward. This was despite the fact that,
              after rewarded trials, reach variability in the patients was
              comparable to healthy controls. In summary, we found that
              movement variability is partially a form of exploration driven by
              the recent history of rewards. When the function of the human
              basal ganglia is compromised, the reward-dependent control of
              movement variability is impaired, particularly affecting the
              ability to increase variability after unsuccessful outcomes.",

              can also lead to small but consistent changes in the sense of arm
              position. Studies have suggested that this sensory effect may be
              the result of recalibration of a forward model that associates
              motor commands with their sensory consequences. Here we
              investigated whether similar perceptual changes occur in the
              lower limbs after learning a new walking pattern on a split-belt
              treadmill--a task that critically involves proprioception.
              Specifically, we studied how this motor learning task affects
              perception of leg speed during walking, perception of leg
              position during standing or walking, and perception of contact
              force during stepping. Our results show that split-belt
              adaptation leads to robust motor aftereffects and alters the
              perception of leg speed during walking. This is specific to the
              direction of walking that was trained during adaptation (i.e.,
              backward or forward). The change in leg speed perception accounts
              for roughly half of the observed motor aftereffect. In contrast,
              split-belt adaptation does not alter the perception of leg
              position during standing or walking and does not change the
              perception of stepping force. Our results demonstrate that there
              is a recalibration of a sensory percept specific to the domain of
              the perturbation that was applied during walking (i.e., speed but
              not position or force). Furthermore, the motor and sensory
              consequences of locomotor adaptation may be linked, suggesting

  abstract = "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review examines recent brain imaging
              studies that might contribute to delivering better recovery of
              motor function after stroke. RECENT FINDINGS: Most recent studies
              characterize differences in structural and functional
              organization of the poststroke brain in relation to impairment,
              or measure alterations in brain organization as the result of one
              form of therapy or another. These studies have not altered
              clinical practice. New approaches can test specific models of
              motor recovery after stroke. Firstly, anatomical assessment of
              key motor pathways, particularly corticospinal tract, may be
              useful in predicting long-term outcomes if used in combination
              with early clinical scores. Secondly, assessment of neuronal
              oscillations with electro or magneto-encephalography may provide
              a novel way of assessing the balance between excitatory and
              inhibitory cortical processes and thereby provide biomarkers of
              the potential for experience-dependent plasticity. SUMMARY: Most
              recent studies are observational and do not test a plausible
              model of motor recovery after stroke. Brain imaging studies of
              stroke recovery need to consider how to provide tools to aid
              prediction of long-term outcome or response to treatment, or
              describe potential therapeutic targets for novel recovery
              promoting interventions, if they are to be clinically useful.",

              movements are two different motor primitives which recruit, at
              least partially, distinct neural circuitries. In particular,
              rhythmic movements recruit a smaller cortical network than
              discrete movements. The goal of this paper is to compare the
              levels of disability in performing rhythmic and discrete
              movements after a stroke. More precisely, we tested the
              hypothesis that rhythmic movements should be less affected than
              discrete ones, because they recruit neural circuitries that are
              less likely to be damaged by the stroke. Eleven stroke patients
              and eleven age-matched control subjects performed discrete and
              rhythmic movements using an end-effector robot (REAplan). The
              rhythmic movement condition was performed with and without visual
              targets to further decrease cortical recruitment. Movement
              kinematics was analyzed through specific metrics, capturing the
              degree of smoothness and harmonicity. We reported three main
              observations: (1) the movement smoothness of the paretic arm was
              more severely degraded for discrete movements than rhythmic
              movements; (2) most of the patients performed rhythmic movements
              with a lower harmonicity than controls; and (3) visually guided
              rhythmic movements were more altered than non-visually guided
              rhythmic movements. These results suggest a hierarchy in the
              levels of impairment: Discrete movements are more affected than
              rhythmic ones, which are more affected if they are visually
              guided. These results are a new illustration that discrete and
              rhythmic movements are two fundamental primitives in upper-limb
              movements. Moreover, this hierarchy of impairment opens new

              neurologic recovery, and as a result accurate predictions at the
              individual level, will be facilitated by developing computational
              models of the salient neural processes, including plasticity and
              learning systems of the brain, and integrating them into a
              context specific to rehabilitation. Here, we therefore discuss
              Computational Neurorehabilitation, a newly emerging field aimed
              at modeling plasticity and motor learning to understand and
              improve movement recovery of individuals with neurologic
              impairment. We first explain how the emergence of robotics and

              development and testing of such models increasingly feasible. We
              then review key aspects of plasticity and motor learning that

              coordinated movements, surprisingly Parkinson's patients with
              freezing of gait typically remain able to bicycle despite severe
              difficulties in walking. This observation suggests functional
              differences in the motor networks subserving bicycling and
              walking. However, a direct comparison of brain activity related
              to bicycling and walking has never been performed, neither in
              healthy participants nor in patients. Such a comparison could
              potentially help elucidating the cortical involvement in motor
              control and the mechanisms through which bicycling ability may be
              preserved in patients with freezing of gait. The aim of this
              study was to contrast the cortical oscillatory dynamics involved
              in bicycling and walking in healthy participants. To this end,
              EEG and EMG data of 14 healthy participants were analyzed, who
              cycled on a stationary bicycle at a slow cadence of 40
              revolutions per minute (rpm) and walked at 40 strides per minute
              (spm), respectively. Relative to walking, bicycling was
              associated with a stronger power decrease in the high beta band
              (23-35 Hz) during movement initiation and execution, followed by
              a stronger beta power increase after movement termination.
              Walking, on the other hand, was characterized by a stronger and
              persisting alpha power (8-12 Hz) decrease. Both bicycling and
              walking exhibited movement cycle-dependent power modulation in
              the 24-40 Hz range that was correlated with EMG activity. This
              modulation was significantly stronger in walking. The present
              findings reveal differential cortical oscillatory dynamics in
              motor control for two types of complex coordinated motor
              behavior, i.e., bicycling and walking. Bicycling was associated
              with a stronger sustained cortical activation as indicated by the
              stronger high beta power decrease during movement execution and
              less cortical motor control within the movement cycle. We
              speculate this to be due to the more continuous nature of
              bicycling demanding less phase-dependent sensory processing and
              motor planning, as opposed to walking.",

              and target-related sensory signals to encode a motor goal.
              Surprisingly, many of these regions show sustained activity
              during reach preparation even when target location is not
              specified, i.e., when a motor goal cannot be unambiguously

              without knowledge of target location was associated with a

              movements as duration decreased, this study tested whether
              smoothly rhythmic movements could be maintained as duration
              increased. Participants performed horizontal movements between
              two targets, paced by sounds with intervals that increased from 1
              to 6 s by 200 ms per cycle and then decreased again. The
              instruction emphasized smooth rhythmic movements without
              interspersed dwell times. We hypothesized that 1) when
              oscillatory motions slow down, smoothness decreases; 2) slower
              oscillatory motions are executed as submovements or even discrete
              movements; and 3) the transition between smooth oscillations and
              submovements shows hysteresis. An alternative hypothesis was that
              4) removing visual feedback restores smoothness, indicative of
              visually evoked corrections causing the irregularity. Results
              showed that humans could not perform slow and smooth oscillatory
              movements. Harmonicity decreased with longer intervals, and dwell
              times between cycles appeared and became prominent at slower
              speeds. Velocity profiles showed an increase with cycle duration
              of the number of overlapping submovements. There was weak
              evidence of hysteresis in the transition between these two types
              of movement. Eliminating vision had no effect, suggesting that
              intermittent visually evoked corrections did not underlie this
              phenomenon. These results show that it is hard for humans to
              execute smooth rhythmic motions very slowly. Instead, they
              ``default'' to another dynamic primitive and compose motion as a
              sequence of overlapping submovements.NEW \& NOTEWORTHY
              Complementing a large body of prior work showing advantages of
              composing primitives to manage the complexity of motor control,
              this paper uncovers a limitation due to composition of behavior
              from dynamic primitives: while slower execution frequently makes
              a task easier, there is a limit and it is hard for humans to move
              very slowly. We suggest that this remarkable limitation is not
              due to inadequacies of muscle, nor to slow neural communication,
              but is a consequence of how the control of movement is organized.",

              cycling",
  author   = "Straw, A H and Hoogkamer, W and Kram, R",
  abstract = "PURPOSE: Historically, the efficiency of leg cycling has been
              difficult to change. However, arm cycling research indicates that
              relative crank angle changes can improve efficiency. Therefore,
              we investigated if leg cycling with different relative crank
              angles affects efficiency. METHODS: Ten healthy, male,
              recreational bicycle riders (27.8 +/- 8.2 years, mean +/- SD,
              mass 69.8 +/- 3.2 kg) pedaled a pan-loaded cycle ergometer at a
              fixed power output of 150 watts at a cadence of 90 RPM. Each
              subject completed six, 5-min trials in random order at relative
              crank angles of 180 degrees , 135 degrees , 90 degrees , 45
              degrees , 0 degrees , and 180 degrees . We averaged rates of
              oxygen uptake ([Formula: see text]) and carbon dioxide production
              ([Formula: see text]), and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) for
              the last 2 min of each trial. RESULTS: Crank angles other than
              180 degrees required a greater metabolic cost. As relative crank
              angle decreased from 180 degrees , metabolic power monotonically
              increased by 1.6\% at 135 degrees to 8.2\% greater when the
              relative crank angle was 0 degrees (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We
              find that, unlike arm cycling, radically changing the relative
              crank angle on a bicycle from an out-of-phase (180 degrees ) to
              in-phase (0 degrees ) position decreases leg cycling efficiency
              by ~8\%. We attribute the increase to changes in cost of
              breathing, muscle co-activation, trunk stabilization, power
              fluctuations, and possibly lifting the legs during the upstroke.

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Although balance training is considered the most
              effective treatment for balance impairments in Parkinson's
              disease (PD), few studies have examined if learning for balance
              control remains intact with PD. This study aimed to determine if
              learning for automatic postural responses is preserved in people
              with PD. METHODS: Eleven participants with moderate PD
              (68+/-6.4years; H\&Y: 2-3) on their usual medication maintained
              balance on a platform that oscillated forward and backward with
              variable amplitude and constant frequency. Participants completed
              42 trials during one training session, and retention and transfer
              tests following a 24-h delay. Performance was measured by
              comparing spatial and temporal measures of whole-body centre of
              mass (COM) with platform displacements. Learning was compared
              between participants with PD and previously reported, age-matched
              older adults (Van Ooteghem et al., 2010). RESULTS: Although
              postural responses in participants with PD were impaired compared
              to control participants, a majority of PD participants improved
              their postural responses with practice as revealed by reduced COM
              displacements and improved phase relationships between COM and
              platform motion. Rates of improvement were comparable between
              groups demonstrating preserved adaptive capacity for participants
              with PD. Similar to control participants, the PD group moved
              toward anticipatory COM control as a strategy for improving
              stability, exhibited short-term retention of performance
              improvements, and demonstrated generalizability of the learned
              responses. Rate of improvement with practice, but not retention,
              was related to severity of motor impairments. CONCLUSIONS:
              Patients with moderate PD on medication demonstrate retention of
              improvements in automatic postural responses with practice

              These outcomes are presumed to result from enhanced interlimb
              connectivity and CPG function. The extent to which rhythmic arm
              training activates interlimb CPG networks for locomotion remains
              unclear and was assessed by studying chronic stroke participants
              before and after 5 wk of arm cycling training. Strength was
              assessed bilaterally via maximal voluntary isometric contractions
              in the legs and hands. Muscle activation during arm cycling and
              transfer to treadmill walking were assessed in the more affected
              (MA) and less affected (LA) sides via surface electromyography.
              Changes to interlimb coupling during rhythmic movement were
              evaluated using modulation of cutaneous reflexes elicited by
              electrical stimulation of the superficial radial nerve at the
              wrist. Bilateral soleus stretch reflexes were elicited at rest
              and during 1-Hz arm cycling. Clinical function tests assessed
              walking, balance, and motor function. Results show significant
              changes in function and neurophysiological integrity. Training
              increased bilateral grip strength, force during MA
              plantarflexion, and muscle activation. ``Normalization'' of
              cutaneous reflex modulation was found during arm cycling. There
              was enhanced activity in the dorsiflexor muscles on the MA side
              during the swing phase of walking. Enhanced interlimb coupling
              was shown by increased modulation of MA soleus stretch reflex
              amplitudes during arm cycling after training. Clinical
              evaluations showed enhanced walking ability and balance. These
              results are consistent with training-induced changes in CPG
              function and interlimb connectivity and underscore the need for
              arm training in the functional rehabilitation of walking after
              neurotrauma. NEW \& NOTEWORTHY It has been suggested but not

              strength, clinical function, coordination of muscle activity
              during walking, and neurological connectivity between the arms

              coordination between the biomechanics of the bipedal gait cycle
              and the eye movements that gather the information needed to guide
              foot placement. However, little is known about how the visual and
              locomotor systems work together to support movement through the
              world. We developed a system to simultaneously record gaze and
              full-body kinematics during locomotion over different outdoor
              terrains. We found that not only do walkers tune their gaze
              behavior to the specific information needed to traverse paths of
              varying complexity but that they do so while maintaining a
              constant temporal look-ahead window across all terrains. This
              strategy allows walkers to use gaze to tailor their energetically
              optimal preferred gait cycle to the upcoming path in order to
              balance between the drive to move efficiently and the need to
              place the feet in stable locations. Eye movements and locomotion
              are intimately linked in a way that reflects the integration of
              energetic costs, environmental uncertainty, and momentary
              informational demands of the locomotor task. Thus, the

              utilized experimental protocol under remarkably different split

              with regard to adaptive process under the small speed ratios. It
              is important to know the nature of adaptive process under ratio
              smaller than 1:2, because systematic evaluation of the gait
              adaptation under small to moderate split ratios would enable us
              to examine relative contribution of two forms of adaptation
              (reactive feedback and predictive feedforward control) on gait

              split-belt treadmill adaptation under five belt speed difference
              conditions (from 1:1.2 to 1:2). Gait parameters related to
              reactive control (stance time) showed quick adjustments
              immediately after imposing the split-belt walking in all five
              speed ratios. Meanwhile, parameters related to predictive control
              (step length and anterior force) showed a clear pattern of
              adaptation and subsequent aftereffects except for the 1:1.2
              adaptation. Additionally, the 1:1.2 ratio was distinguished from
              other ratios by cluster analysis based on the relationship

              proportionally dependent on the speed ratio of the split-belt. On

              motor adaptation paradigms for the lower limbs are typically
              based on locomotion tasks, where the necessity of maintaining a
              stable gait pattern is the main driver of adaptations and could
              possibly mask other underlying processes. The aim of this study
              was to investigate whether small temporal or spatial asymmetries
              can trigger motor adaptations during stationary cycling tasks
              where stability is not directly compromised. Therefore 14 healthy
              individuals participated in two experiments: in one the angle
              between the crank arms of the pedals was altered by 10 degrees to
              induce a temporal asymmetry; in the other the length of one pedal
              was shortened by 2.4 cm to induce a spatial asymmetry. We
              recorded the acceleration of the crank arms during the exercises
              and the EMGs of 16 muscles. The analysis of the accelerometer
              data was used to investigate the presence and extent of motor
              adaptations. Muscle synergies analysis was used to quantify
              changes in neuromuscular control. We found that motor adaptations
              are present in response to temporal asymmetries. This adaptation
              was obtained, at the neuromuscular level, mostly by rotating two
              synergies on the perturbed side. Spatial asymmetries, on the
              other hand, appear to trigger a feedback-driven response that
              does not present an aftereffect and is not consistent with a
              motor adaptation. All the changes in neuromuscular control were

              customize data processing using command history and interactive
              'pop' functions. Experienced MATLAB users can use EEGLAB data
              structures and stand-alone signal processing functions to write

              actual metabolic minimization exists in locomotion, actual
              metabolic cost has yet to be measured during motor learning
              and/or arm reaching. Here, we measured metabolic power
              consumption using expired gas analysis, as humans learned novel
              arm reaching dynamics. We hypothesized that (1) metabolic power
              would decrease with motor learning and (2) muscle activity and
              coactivation would parallel changes in metabolic power. Seated
              subjects made horizontal planar reaching movements toward a
              target using a robotic arm. The novel dynamics involved
              compensating for a viscous curl force field that perturbed
              reaching movements. Metabolic power was measured continuously
              throughout the protocol. Subjects decreased movement error and
              learned the novel dynamics. By the end of learning, net metabolic
              power decreased by ~20\% (~0.1 W/kg) from initial learning.
              Muscle activity and coactivation also decreased with motor
              learning. Interestingly, distinct and significant reductions in
              metabolic power occurred even after muscle activity and
              coactivation had stabilized and movement changes were small.
              These results provide the first evidence of actual metabolic
              reduction during motor learning and for a reaching task. Further,
              they suggest that muscle activity may not explain changes in
              metabolic cost as completely as previously thought. Additional
              mechanisms such as more subtle features of arm muscle activity,
              changes in activity of other muscles, and/or more efficient
              neural processes may also underlie the reduction in metabolic

              data-driven method for parsing brain and non-brain EEG source
              signals, mixed by volume conduction to the scalp electrodes, into
              a set of maximally temporally and often functionally independent
              components (ICs). Many ICs may be identified with a precise
              physiological or non-physiological origin. However, this process
              is hindered by partial instability in ICA results that can arise
              from noise in the data. Here we propose RELICA (RELiable ICA), a
              novel method to characterize IC reliability within subjects.
              RELICA first computes IC ``dipolarity'' a measure of
              physiological plausibility, plus a measure of IC consistency
              across multiple decompositions of bootstrap versions of the input
              data. RELICA then uses these two measures to visualize and
              cluster the separated ICs, providing a within-subject measure of
              IC reliability that does not involve checking for its occurrence
              across subjects. We demonstrate the use of RELICA on EEG data
              recorded from 14 subjects performing a working memory experiment
              and show that many brain and ocular artifact ICs are correctly
              classified as ``stable'' (highly repeatable across decompositions
              of bootstrapped versions of the input data). Many stable ICs
              appear to originate in the brain, while other stable ICs account
              for identifiable non-brain processes such as line noise. RELICA
              might be used with any linear blind source separation algorithm

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: High-density electroencephelography (EEG) can provide
              an insight into human brain function during real-world activities
              with walking. Some recent studies have used EEG to characterize
              brain activity during walking, but the relative contributions of
              movement artifact and electrocortical activity have been
              difficult to quantify. We aimed to characterize movement artifact
              recorded by EEG electrodes at a range of walking speeds and to
              test the efficacy of artifact removal methods. We also quantified
              the similarity between movement artifact recorded by EEG
              electrodes and a head-mounted accelerometer. APPROACH: We used a
              novel experimental method to isolate and record movement artifact
              with EEG electrodes during walking. We blocked
              electrophysiological signals using a nonconductive layer
              (silicone swim cap) and simulated an electrically conductive
              scalp on top of the swim cap using a wig coated with conductive
              gel. We recorded motion artifact EEG data from nine young human
              subjects walking on a treadmill at speeds from 0.4 to 1.6 m
              s(-1). We then tested artifact removal methods including moving
              average and wavelet-based techniques. MAIN RESULTS: Movement
              artifact recorded with EEG electrodes varied considerably, across
              speed, subject, and electrode location. The movement artifact
              measured with EEG electrodes did not correlate well with head
              acceleration. All of the tested artifact removal methods
              attenuated low-frequency noise but did not completely remove
              movement artifact. The spectral power fluctuations in the
              movement artifact data resembled data from some previously
              published studies of EEG during walking. SIGNIFICANCE: Our
              results suggest that EEG data recorded during walking likely
              contains substantial movement artifact that: cannot be explained
              by head accelerations; varies across speed, subject, and channel;
              and cannot be removed using traditional signal processing
              methods. Future studies should focus on more sophisticated
              methods for removal of EEG movement artifact to advance the

              combined with independent component analysis (ICA) and source
              localization techniques, it can model electrocortical activity as
              arising from temporally independent signals located in spatially
              distinct cortical areas. However, for mobile tasks, it is not
              clear how movement artifacts influence ICA and source
              localization. We devised a novel method to collect pure movement
              artifact data (devoid of any electrophysiological signals) with a
              256-channel EEG system. We first blocked true electrocortical
              activity using a silicone swim cap. Over the silicone layer, we
              placed a simulated scalp with electrical properties similar to
              real human scalp. We collected EEG movement artifact signals from
              ten healthy, young subjects wearing this setup as they walked on
              a treadmill at speeds from 0.4-1.6 m/s. We performed ICA and
              dipole fitting on the EEG movement artifact data to quantify how
              accurately these methods would identify the artifact signals as
              non-neural. ICA and dipole fitting accurately localized 99\% of
              the independent components in non-neural locations or lacked
              dipolar characteristics. The remaining 1\% of sources had
              locations within the brain volume and low residual variances, but
              had topographical maps, power spectra, time courses, and event
              related spectral perturbations typical of non-neural sources.
              Caution should be exercised when interpreting ICA for data that
              includes semi-periodic artifacts including artifact arising from
              human walking. Alternative methods are needed for the
              identification and separation of movement artifact in mobile EEG
              signals, especially methods that can be performed in real time.
              Separating true brain signals from motion artifact could clear
              the way for EEG brain computer interfaces for assistance during

              both conditions, but was greater during incline walking in the
              anterior cingulate, sensorimotor and posterior parietal clusters.
              We found greater gamma power during level walking in the left
              sensorimotor and anterior cingulate clusters. We also found
              distinct alpha and beta fluctuations, depending on the phase of
              the gait cycle for the left and right sensorimotor cortices,
              indicating cortical lateralization for both walking conditions.
              We validated the results by isolating movement artifact. We found
              that the frequency activation patterns of the artifact were
              different than the actual EEG data, providing evidence that the
              differences between walking conditions were cortically driven
              rather than a residual artifact of the experiment. These findings
              suggest that the locomotor pattern adjustments necessary to walk
              on an incline compared with level surface may require supraspinal
              input, especially from the left sensorimotor cortex, anterior
              cingulate, and posterior parietal areas. These results are a
              promising step toward the use of EEG as a feed-forward control
              signal for ambulatory brain-computer interface technologies.",

  abstract = "Recently, it has been demonstrated that bicycling ability remains
              surprisingly preserved in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients who
              suffer from freezing of gait. Cycling has been also proposed as a
              therapeutic means of treating PD symptoms, with some preliminary
              success. The neural mechanisms behind these phenomena are however
              not yet understood. One of the reasons is that the investigations
              of neuronal activity during pedaling have been up to now limited
              to PET and fMRI studies, which restrict the temporal resolution
              of analysis, and to scalp EEG focused on cortical activation.
              However, deeper brain structures like the basal ganglia are also
              associated with control of voluntary motor movements like cycling
              and are affected by PD. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes
              implanted for therapy in PD patients provide rare and unique
              access to directly record basal ganglia activity with a very high
              temporal resolution. In this paper we present an experimental
              setup allowing combined investigation of basal ganglia local
              field potentials (LFPs) and scalp EEG underlying bicycling in PD
              patients. The main part of the setup is a bike simulator
              consisting of a classic Dutch-style bicycle frame mounted on a
              commercially available ergometer. The pedal resistance is
              controllable in real-time by custom software and the pedal
              position is continuously tracked by custom Arduino-based
              electronics using optical and magnetic sensors. A portable
              bioamplifier records the pedal position signal, the angle of the
              knee, and the foot pressure together with EEG, EMG, and basal
              ganglia LFPs. A handlebar-mounted display provides additional
              information for patients riding the bike simulator, including the
              current and target pedaling rate. In order to demonstrate the
              utility of the setup, example data from pilot recordings are
              shown. The presented experimental setup provides means to
              directly record basal ganglia activity not only during cycling
              but also during other movement tasks in patients who have
              undergone DBS treatment. Thus, it can facilitate studies
              comparing bicycling and walking, to elucidate why PD patients
              often retain the ability to bicycle despite severe freezing of
              gait. Moreover it can help clarifying the mechanism through which
              cycling may have therapeutic benefits.",

              rewarding (or less effortful) option. However, they also move

              effort not only affect decision-making, they also influence motor
              control [6, 7]. How does the brain compute the effort
              requirements of a task? Here, we considered data acquired during
              walking, reaching, flying, or isometric force production. In
              analyzing the decision-making and motor-control behaviors of
              various animals, we considered the possibility that the brain may
              estimate effort objectively, via the metabolic energy consumed to
              produce the action. We measured the energetic cost of reaching
              and found that, like walking, it was convex in time, with a
              global minimum, implying that there existed a movement speed that
              minimized effort. However, reward made it worthwhile to be
              energetically inefficient. Using a framework in which utility of
              an action depended on reward and energetic cost, both discounted
              in time, we found that it was possible to account for a body of
              data in which animals were free to choose how to move (reach slow
              or fast), as well as what to do (walk or fly, produce force F1 or
              F2). We suggest that some forms of decision-making and motor
              control may share a common utility in which the brain represents
              the effort associated with performing an action objectively via
              its metabolic energy cost and then, like reward, temporally

              Non-invasive active-electrode scalp electroencephalography (EEG)
              signals were recorded and a systematic EEG processing method was
              implemented to reduce artifacts. Source localization combined
              with independent component analysis and k-means clustering

              Posterior Parietal Cortex (PPC), and Central Sensorimotor Cortex
              (SMC). Results showed that the changes of spectral power in the
              PPC and SMC clusters were associated with the level of motor task
              demands. Specifically, we observed alpha and beta suppression at
              the beginning of the gait cycle in both SA and RA walking
              (relative to LW) in the SMC. Additionally, we observed
              significant beta rebound (synchronization) at the initial swing
              phase of the gait cycle, which may be indicative of active
              cortical signaling involved in maintaining the current locomotor
              state. An increase of low gamma band power in this cluster was
              also found in SA walking. In the PPC, the low gamma band power
              increased with the level of task demands (from LW to RA and SA).
              Additionally, our results provide evidence that electrocortical
              amplitude modulations (relative to average gait cycle) are
              correlated with the level of difficulty in locomotion tasks.
              Specifically, the modulations in the PPC shifted to higher
              frequency bands when the subjects walked in RA and SA conditions.
              Moreover, low gamma modulations in the central sensorimotor area
              were observed in the LW walking and shifted to lower frequency

              electroencephalography (EEG) in low-cost portable devices, has
              opened the door to a new generation of applications processing a
              small number of EEG channels for health monitoring and
              brain-computer interfacing. These recordings are, however,
              contaminated by many sources of noise degrading the signals of
              interest, thus compromising the interpretation of the underlying
              brain state. In this paper, we propose a new data-driven
              algorithm to effectively remove ocular and muscular artifacts
              from single-channel EEG: the surrogate-based artifact removal
              (SuBAR). METHODS: by means of the time-frequency analysis of
              surrogate data, our approach is able to identify and filter
              automatically ocular and muscular artifacts embedded in
              single-channel EEG. RESULTS: in a comparative study using
              artificially contaminated EEG signals, the efficacy of the
              algorithm in terms of noise removal and signal distortion was
              superior to other traditionally-employed single-channel EEG
              denoizing techniques: wavelet thresholding and the canonical
              correlation analysis combined with an advanced version of the
              empirical mode decomposition. Even in the presence of mild and
              severe artifacts, our artifact removal method provides a relative
              error 4 to 5 times lower than traditional techniques.
              SIGNIFICANCE: in view of these results, the SuBAR method is a

              healthcare systems, sleep stage scoring, or anesthesia

              related to the production of rhythmic movements",
  author   = "Chemin, B and Huang, G and Mulders, D and Mouraux, A",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Many sensorimotor functions are intrinsically
              rhythmic, and are underlined by neural processes that are
              functionally distinct from neural responses related to the
              processing of transient events. EEG frequency tagging is a
              technique that is increasingly used in neuroscience to study
              these processes. It relies on the fact that perceiving and/or
              producing rhythms generates periodic neural activity that
              translates into periodic variations of the EEG signal. In the EEG
              spectrum, those variations appear as peaks localized at the
              frequency of the rhythm and its harmonics. NEW METHOD: Many
              natural rhythms, such as music or dance, are not strictly
              periodic and, instead, show fluctuations of their period over
              time. Here, we introduce a time-warping method to identify
              non-strictly-periodic EEG activities in the frequency domain.
              RESULTS: EEG time-warping can be used to characterize the
              sensorimotor activity related to the performance of self-paced
              rhythmic finger movements. Furthermore, the EEG time-warping
              method can disentangle auditory- and movement-related EEG
              activity produced when participants perform rhythmic movements
              synchronized to an acoustic rhythm. This is possible because the
              movement-related activity has different period fluctuations than
              the auditory-related activity. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS:
              With the classic frequency-tagging approach, rhythm fluctuations
              result in a spreading of the peaks to neighboring frequencies, to
              the point that they cannot be distinguished from background
              noise. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed time-warping procedure is as a
              simple and effective mean to study natural non-strictly-periodic
              rhythmic neural processes such as rhythmic movement production,
              acoustic rhythm perception and sensorimotor synchronization.",

              unknown. Here, in a Mobile Brain/Body Imaging (MoBI) approach
              sixteen young adults walked on a treadmill with high-density EEG

              effects of cognitive load were assessed by the performance of a

              whether by using high-density electroencephalography (EEG) and

              found early theta synchronization and late alpha-beta (8-30 Hz)

              strongest in occipito-parietal areas during visual perturbations

              These results suggest a similar time-frequency electrocortical

              substantive differences in the brain areas involved for visual

              walked at their preferred speed (4.2, SD 0.4 km h(-1)), which was
              matched across both gait conditions. Event-related power,
              corticomuscular coherence (CMC) and inter-trial coherence (ITC)
              were assessed for EEG from bilateral sensorimotor cortices and
              EMG from the bilateral tibialis anterior (TA) muscles. Cortical
              power, CMC and ITC at theta, alpha, beta and gamma frequencies
              (4-45 Hz) increased during the double support phase of the gait
              cycle for both overground and treadmill walking. High beta (21-30

              pattern-generating networks. However, the differences between
              their kinematics and kinetics imply that corresponding muscle
              activations may also be quite different. We examined the
              differences between walking and running by recording kinematics
              and electromyographic (EMG) activity in 32 ipsilateral limb and
              trunk muscles during human locomotion, and compared the effects
              of speed (3-12 km/h) and gait. We found that the timing of muscle
              activation was accounted for by five basic temporal activation
              components during running as we previously found for walking.
              Each component was loaded on similar sets of leg muscles in both
              gaits but generally on different sets of upper trunk and shoulder
              muscles. The major difference between walking and running was
              that one temporal component, occurring during stance, was shifted
              to an earlier phase in the step cycle during running. These
              muscle activation differences between gaits did not simply depend
              on locomotion speed as shown by recordings during each gait over
              the same range of speeds (5-9 km/h). The results are consistent
              with an organization of locomotion motor programs having two
              parts, one that organizes muscle activation during swing and
              another during stance and the transition to swing. The timing
              shift between walking and running reflects therefore the

  abstract = "Several recent studies have used matrix factorization algorithms
              to assess the hypothesis that behaviors might be produced through
              the combination of a small number of muscle synergies. Although
              generally agreeing in their basic conclusions, these studies have
              used a range of different algorithms, making their interpretation
              and integration difficult. We therefore compared the performance
              of these different algorithms on both simulated and experimental
              data sets. We focused on the ability of these algorithms to
              identify the set of synergies underlying a data set. All data
              sets consisted of nonnegative values, reflecting the nonnegative
              data of muscle activation patterns. We found that the performance
              of principal component analysis (PCA) was generally lower than
              that of the other algorithms in identifying muscle synergies.
              Factor analysis (FA) with varimax rotation was better than PCA,
              and was generally at the same levels as independent component
              analysis (ICA) and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). ICA
              performed very well on data sets corrupted by constant variance
              Gaussian noise, but was impaired on data sets with
              signal-dependent noise and when synergy activation coefficients
              were correlated. Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) performed
              similarly to ICA and FA on data sets with signal-dependent noise
              and was generally robust across data sets. The best algorithms
              were ICA applied to the subspace defined by PCA (ICAPCA) and a
              version of probabilistic ICA with nonnegativity constraints
              (pICA). We also evaluated some commonly used criteria to identify
              the number of synergies underlying a data set, finding that only
              likelihood ratios based on factor analysis identified the correct
              number of synergies for data sets with signal-dependent noise in
              some cases. We then proposed an ad hoc procedure, finding that it
              was able to identify the correct number in a larger number of
              cases. Finally, we applied these methods to an experimentally
              obtained data set. The best performing algorithms (FA, ICA, NMF,
              ICAPCA, pICA) identified synergies very similar to one another.
              Based on these results, we discuss guidelines for using
              factorization algorithms to analyze muscle activation patterns.
              More generally, the ability of several algorithms to identify the
              correct muscle synergies and activation coefficients in simulated
              data, combined with their consistency when applied to
              physiological data sets, suggests that the muscle synergies found
              by a particular algorithm are not an artifact of that algorithm,

              and temporal coordination of multiple muscles. Complex muscle
              activation patterns characterizing postural responses suggest the
              need for independent muscle control. However, our previous work
              shows that postural responses in cats can be robustly reproduced
              by the activation of a few muscle synergies. We now investigate
              whether a similar neural strategy is used for human postural
              control. We hypothesized that a few muscle synergies could
              account for the intertrial variability in automatic postural
              responses from different perturbation directions, as well as
              different postural strategies. Postural responses to
              multidirectional support-surface translations in 16 muscles of
              the lower back and leg were analyzed in nine healthy subjects.
              Six or fewer muscle synergies were required to reproduce the
              postural responses of each subject. The composition and temporal
              activation of several muscle synergies identified across all
              subjects were consistent with the previously identified ``ankle''
              and ``hip'' strategies in human postural responses. Moreover,
              intertrial variability in muscle activation patterns was
              successfully reproduced by modulating the activity of the various
              muscle synergies. This suggests that trial-to-trial variations in
              the activation of individual muscles are correlated and,
              moreover, represent variations in the amplitude of descending
              neural commands that activate individual muscle synergies.
              Finally, composition and temporal activation of most of the
              muscle synergies were similar across subjects. These results

              activity and active forces during automatic postural responses in
              cats standing at multiple postural configurations. This
              characterization depended critically upon the assumption that the
              endpoint force vector (synergy force vector) produced by the
              activation of each muscle synergy rotated with the limb axis as
              the hindlimb posture varied in the sagittal plane. Here, we used
              a detailed, 3D static model of the hindlimb to confirm that this
              assumption is biomechanically plausible: as we varied the model
              posture, simulated synergy force vectors rotated monotonically
              with the limb axis in the parasagittal plane (r2=0.94+/-0.08). We
              then tested whether a neural strategy of using these five
              functional muscle synergies provides the same force-generating
              capability as controlling each of the 31 muscles individually. We
              compared feasible force sets (FFSs) from the model with and
              without a muscle synergy organization. FFS volumes were
              significantly reduced with the muscle synergy organization
              (F=1556.01, p<<0.01), and as posture varied, the synergy-limited
              FFSs changed in shape, consistent with changes in experimentally
              measured active forces. In contrast, nominal FFS shapes were
              invariant with posture, reinforcing prior findings that postural
              forces cannot be predicted by hindlimb biomechanics alone. We
              propose that an internal model for postural force generation may
              coordinate functional muscle synergies that are invariant in
              intrinsic limb coordinates, and this reduced-dimension control
              scheme reduces the set of forces available for postural control.",

              injury may alter the organization of motor modules and their
              biomechanical outputs. We first tested the hypothesis that muscle
              activation patterns during walking are produced through the
              variable activation of a small set of motor modules. In 20
              healthy control subjects, EMG signals from eight leg muscles were
              measured across a range of walking speeds. Four motor modules
              identified through nonnegative matrix factorization were
              sufficient to account for variability of muscle activation from

              post-stroke hemiparesis would have altered motor modules, leading

              artifacts that originate at the skin-electrode interface, in the
              electronics that amplifies the signals, and in external sources.
              Modern technology is substantially immune to some of these
              noises, but not to the baseline noise and the movement artifact
              noise. These noise sources have frequency spectra that
              contaminate the low-frequency part of the sEMG frequency
              spectrum. There are many factors which must be taken into
              consideration when determining the appropriate filter
              specifications to remove these artifacts; they include the muscle
              tested and type of contraction, the sensor configuration, and
              specific noise source. The band-pass determination is always a
              compromise between (a) reducing noise and artifact contamination,
              and (b) preserving the desired information from the sEMG signal.
              This study was designed to investigate the effects of mechanical
              perturbations and noise that are typically encountered during
              sEMG recordings in clinical and related applications. The

              rates of the movement artifact and the sEMG signal as a function
              of the filter band pass. When this relationship is combined with
              other considerations related to the informational content of the
              signal, the signal distortion of filters, and the kinds of
              artifacts evaluated in this study, a Butterworth filter with a

              analyzing such data in large time bins, increasing statistical
              power by reducing the number of comparisons. We performed ANOVA
              in the wavelet domain because differences between curves tend to
              be represented by a few temporally localized wavelets, which we
              transformed back to the time domain for visualization. We
              compared wfANOVA and ANOVA performed in the time domain (tANOVA)
              on both experimental electromyographic (EMG) signals from
              responses to perturbation during standing balance across changes
              in peak perturbation acceleration (3 levels) and velocity (4
              levels) and on simulated data with known contrasts. In
              experimental EMG data, wfANOVA revealed the continuous shape and
              magnitude of significant differences over time without a priori
              selection of time bins. However, tANOVA revealed only the largest
              differences at discontinuous time points, resulting in features
              with later onsets and shorter durations than those identified
              using wfANOVA (P < 0.02). Furthermore, wfANOVA required
              significantly fewer (~1/4;x; P < 0.015) significant F tests than
              tANOVA, resulting in post hoc tests with increased power. In

              adequate tools to quantify the biomechanical latitude that the
              nervous system has when selecting muscle activation patterns.
              Here, we identified feasible ranges of individual muscle activity
              during force production in a musculoskeletal model to quantify
              the degree to which biomechanical redundancy allows for
              variability in muscle activation patterns. In a detailed cat
              hindlimb model matched to the posture of three cats, we
              identified the lower and upper bounds on muscle activity in each
              of 31 muscles during static endpoint force production across
              different force directions and magnitudes. Feasible ranges of
              muscle activation were relatively unconstrained across force
              magnitudes such that only a few (0-13\%) muscles were found to be
              truly ``necessary'' (e.g. exhibited non-zero lower bounds) at
              physiological force ranges. Most of the muscles were
              ``optional'', having zero lower bounds, and frequently had
              ``maximal'' upper bounds as well. Moreover, ``optional'' muscles
              were never selected by optimization methods that either minimized
              muscle stress, or that scaled the pattern required for maximum
              force generation. Therefore, biomechanical constraints were
              generally insufficient to restrict or specify muscle activation
              levels for producing a force in a given direction, and many
              muscle patterns exist that could deviate substantially from one
              another but still achieve the task. Our approach could be

              Using motor module (a.k.a., muscle synergy) analyses, we
              identified differences in muscle coordination patterns between

              During beam walking, we found that experts recruited more motor
              modules than novices, suggesting an increase in motor repertoire

              ubiquitous motor control strategy for this population remains
              inconclusive. Co-contraction, the simultaneous activation of
              agonist and antagonist muscles, can be assessed with
              electromyography (EMG) but is often described qualitatively.
              Here, our goal is to determine if co-contraction is associated
              with gait impairments following stroke. Fifteen individuals with
              chronic stroke and nine healthy controls walked on an
              instrumented treadmill at self-selected speed. Surface EMGs were
              collected from the medial gastrocnemius (MG), soleus (SOL), and
              tibialis anterior (TA) of each leg. EMG envelope amplitudes were
              assessed in three ways: (1) no normalization, (2) normalization
              to the maximum value across the gait cycle, or (3) normalization
              to maximal M-wave. Three co-contraction indices were calculated
              across each agonist/antagonist muscle pair (MG/TA and SOL/TA) to
              assess the effect of using various metrics to quantify
              co-contraction. Two factor ANOVAs were used to compare effects of
              group and normalization for each metric. Co-contraction during
              the terminal stance (TSt) phase of gait is not different between
              healthy controls and the paretic leg of individuals post-stroke,
              regardless of the metric used to quantify co-contraction.
              Interestingly, co-contraction was similar between M-max and
              non-normalized EMG; however, normalization does not impact the
              ability to resolve group differences. While a modest correlation
              is revealed between the amount of TSt co-contraction and walking
              speed, the relationship is not sufficiently strong to motivate
              further exploration of a causal link between co-contraction and
              walking function after stroke. Co-contraction does not appear to
              be a common strategy employed by individuals after stroke. We
              recommend exploration of alternative EMG analysis approaches in

              our recent work on locomotor adaptation, which is an error driven
              motor learning process used to alter spatiotemporal elements of
              walking. Locomotor adaptation can be induced using a split-belt

              Practicing split-belt walking changes the coordination between
              the legs, resulting in storage of a new walking pattern. Here, we
              review findings from this experimental paradigm regarding the
              learning and generalization of locomotor adaptation. First, we
              discuss how split-belt walking adaptation develops slowly

              conscious effort to change the walking pattern during split-belt

              exercise on grip strength in young men with Down syndrome (DS).
              This study was a pre-post design. Twelve males with DS were
              assigned to an exercise group, who walked using an incremental
              protocol on a treadmill for 20 min at aerobic levels. Eight
              additional persons with DS were assigned to an attentional
              control group, who watched a video. Measure of grip strength was
              tested pre- and post-interventions. The results showed positively
              significant relationship among grip strength and age (r=.74,

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Gait analysis serves as an important tool for
              clinicians and other health professionals to assess gait patterns
              related to functional limitations due to neurological or
              orthopedic conditions. The purpose of this study was to assess
              the validity of a body-worn inertial sensor system (RehaGait(R))
              for measuring spatiotemporal gait characteristics compared to a
              stationary treadmill (Zebris) and the reliability of both systems
              at different walking speeds and slopes. METHODS: Gait analysis
              was performed during treadmill walking at different speeds
              (habitual walking speed (normal speed); 15 \% above normal
              walking speed; 15 \% below normal walking speed) and slopes (0 \%
              slope; 15 \% slope) in 22 healthy participants twice 1 week
              apart. Walking speed, stride length, cadence and stride time were
              computed from the inertial sensor system and the stationary
              treadmill and compared using repeated measures analysis of
              variance. Effect sizes of differences between systems were
              assessed using Cohen's d, and limits of agreement and systematic
              bias were computed. RESULTS: The RehaGait(R) system slightly
              overestimated stride length (+2.7 \%) and stride time (+0.8 \%)
              and underestimate cadence (-1.5 \%) with small effect sizes for
              all speeds and slopes (Cohen's d 0.80). Walking speed obtained
              with the RehaGait(R) system closely matched the speed set on the
              treadmill tachometer. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC)
              were excellent for speed, cadence and stride time and for stride
              length at normal and fast speed at 0 \% slope (ICC: .91-1.00).
              Good ICC values were found for stride length at slow speed at 0
              \% slope and all speeds at 15 \% slope (ICC: .73-.90). Both
              devices had excellent reliability for most gait characteristics
              (ICC: .91-1.00) except good reliability for the RehaGait(R) for
              stride length at normal and fast speed at 0 \% slope and at slow
              speed at 15 \% slope (ICC: .80-.87). CONCLUSIONS: Larger limits
              of agreement for walking at 15 \% slope suggests that uphill
              walking may influence the reliability of the RehaGait(R) system.
              The RehaGait(R) is a valid and reliable tool for measuring
              spatiotemporal gait characteristics during level and inclined

              walking on the treadmill. 11 young, 11 middle and 14 older-aged
              female adults (mean and SD: 25.5(2.1), 50.6(6.4) and 69.0(4.7)

              sustained perturbation to the swing phase of the right leg for 18
              consecutive gait cycles, followed by a step with the resistance
              unexpectedly removed, via an ankle strap connected to a
              break-and-release system. The margin of stability (MoS) at foot

              boundary of the base of support (BoS) and extrapolated center of
              mass. Older participants showed lower MoS adaptation magnitude in
              the early adaptation phase (steps 1-3) compared to the young and

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: For older adults, falls are a serious health problem,
              with more than 30\% of people older than 65 suffering a fall at
              least once a year. One element often overlooked in the assessment
              of falls is whether a person's balance, walking ability, and
              overall falls risk is affected by performing activities of daily
              living such as walking. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the
              immediate impact of incline walking at a moderate pace on falls
              risk, leg strength, reaction time, gait, and balance in 75
              healthy adults from 30 to 79 years of age. Subjects were
              subdivided into 5 equal groups based on their age (group 1, 30-39
              years; group 2, 40-49 years; group 3, 50-59 years; group 4, 60-69
              years; group 5, 70-79 years). METHODS: Each person's falls risk
              (using the Physiological Profile Assessment), simple reaction
              time, leg strength, walking ability, and standing balance were
              assessed before and after a period of incline walking on an
              automated treadmill. The walking task consisted of three 5-minute
              trials at a faster than preferred pace. Fatigue during walking
              was elicited by increasing the treadmill incline in increments of
              2 degrees (from level) every minute to a maximum of 8 degrees .
              RESULTS: As predicted, significant age-related differences were
              observed before the walking activity. In general, increasing age
              was associated with declines in gait speed, lower limb strength,
              slower reaction times, and increases in overall falls risk.
              Following the treadmill task, older adults exhibited increased
              sway (path length 60-69 years; 10.2 +/- 0.7 to 12.1 +/- 0.7 cm:
              70-79 years; 12.8 +/- 1.1 to 15.1 +/- 0.8 cm), slower reaction
              times (70-79 years; 256 +/- 6 to 287 +/- 8 ms), and declines in
              lower limb strength (60-69 years; 36 +/- 2 to 31 +/- 1 kg: 70-79
              years; 32.3 +/- 2 to 27 +/- 1 kg). However, a significant
              increase in overall falls risk (pre; 0.51 +/- 0.17: post; 1.01
              +/- 0.18) was only seen in the oldest group (70-79 years). For
              all other persons (30-69 years), changes resulting from the
              treadmill-walking task did not lead to a significant increase in
              falls risk. CONCLUSIONS: As most falls occur when an individual
              is moving and/or fatigued, assessing functional properties
              related to balance, gait, strength, and falls risk in older
              adults both at rest and following activity may provide additional
              insight.",

              [Subjects and Methods] Thirty participants were randomly divided
              into three groups: inclined treadmill with rhythmic auditory
              stimulation training group (n=10), inclined treadmill training
              group (n=10), and treadmill training group (n=10). For all

              session, 5 times per week. Two subjects dropped out before study
              completion. [Results] All variables of balance and gait, except
              for the timed up and go test in the treadmill group,
              significantly improved in all groups. Moreover, all variables

              biomedical applications, primarily since they can be implemented
              both in indoor and outdoor applications. In this study, a Trunk
              Motion System (TMS) using printed Body-Worn Sensors (BWS) is
              designed and developed. TMS can measure three-dimensional (3D)
              trunk motions, is lightweight, and is a portable and non-invasive
              system. After the recognition of sensor locations, twelve BWSs
              were printed on stretchable clothing with the purpose of
              measuring the 3D trunk movements. To integrate BWSs data, a
              neural network data fusion algorithm was used. The outcome of
              this algorithm along with the actual 3D anatomical movements
              (obtained by Qualisys system) were used to calibrate the TMS.
              Three healthy participants with different physical
              characteristics participated in the calibration tests. Seven
              different tasks (each repeated three times) were performed,
              involving five planar, and two multiplanar movements. Results
              showed that the accuracy of TMS system was less than 1.0 degrees
              , 0.8 degrees , 0.6 degrees , 0.8 degrees , 0.9 degrees , and 1.3
              degrees for flexion/extension, left/right lateral bending,
              left/right axial rotation, and multi-planar motions,
              respectively. In addition, the accuracy of TMS for the identified
              movement was less than 2.7 degrees . TMS, developed to monitor
              and measure the trunk orientations, can have diverse applications
              in clinical, biomechanical, and ergonomic studies to prevent
              musculoskeletal injuries, and to determine the impact of
              interventions.",

              purpose of this study was to quantify the mechanical performance
              of the orthosis during human walking. Three subjects walked at a
              range of speeds wearing ankle-foot orthoses with either one or
              two artificial muscles working in parallel. The orthosis produced
              similar total peak plantar flexor torque and network across
              speeds independent of the number of muscles used. The orthosis
              generated approximately 57\% of the peak ankle plantar flexor
              torque during stance and performed approximately 70\% of the
              positive plantar flexor work done during normal walking.
              Artificial muscle bandwidth and force-length properties were the
              two primary factors limiting torque production. The lack of peak
              force and work differences between single and double muscle
              conditions can be explained by force-length properties. Subjects
              altered their ankle kinematics between conditions resulting in
              changes in artificial muscle length. In the double muscle

              built pneumatically powered ankle exoskeletons controlled by the

              Nine healthy individuals completed three 30 min sessions walking

              sessions, subjects' net metabolic energy expenditure during
              powered walking progressed from +7\% to -10\% of that during
              unpowered walking. With practice, subjects significantly reduced
              soleus muscle activity (by approximately 28\% root mean square
              EMG, P<0.0001) and negative exoskeleton mechanical power (-0.09 W

              similar patterns to those observed during unpowered walking. At
              the end of the third session, the powered exoskeletons delivered
              approximately 63\% of the average ankle joint positive mechanical

              power generated by all of the joints summed (ankle, knee and hip)
              during unpowered walking. Decreases in total joint positive
              mechanical power due to powered ankle assistance ( approximately
              22\%) were not proportional to reductions in net metabolic power
              ( approximately 10\%). The ;apparent efficiency' of the ankle
              joint muscle-tendon system during human walking ( approximately
              0.61) was much greater than reported values of the ;muscular

              from actively shortening ankle plantar flexor muscle fibers to
              ankle muscle-tendon positive work during walking on steep uphill
              inclines. Although exoskeletons delivered 61\% more mechanical
              work at the ankle up a 15\% grade compared with level walking,
              relative reductions in net metabolic power were similar across

              data for seven participants hopping at four frequencies (2.2,
              2.5, 2.8, and 3.2 Hz). Hopping was performed without an
              exoskeleton; with an springless exoskeleton; and with a
              spring-loaded exoskeleton. Spring-loaded ankle exoskeletons
              reduced plantar flexor muscle activity and the biological
              contribution to ankle joint moment (15-25\%) and average positive
              power (20-40\%). They also facilitated reductions in metabolic
              power (15-20\%) across frequencies from 2.2 to 2.8 Hz compared
              with hopping with a springless exoskeleton. Reductions in
              metabolic power compared with hopping with no exoskeleton were
              restricted to hopping at 2.5 Hz only (12\%). These results
              highlighted the importance of reducing the rate of muscular force
              production and work to achieve metabolic reductions. They also

  abstract = "With efficiencies derived from evolution, growth and learning,
              humans are very well-tuned for locomotion. Metabolic energy used
              during walking can be partly replaced by power input from an
              exoskeleton, but is it possible to reduce metabolic rate without
              providing an additional energy source? This would require an
              improvement in the efficiency of the human-machine system as a
              whole, and would be remarkable given the apparent optimality of
              human gait. Here we show that the metabolic rate of human walking
              can be reduced by an unpowered ankle exoskeleton. We built a
              lightweight elastic device that acts in parallel with the user's
              calf muscles, off-loading muscle force and thereby reducing the
              metabolic energy consumed in contractions. The device uses a
              mechanical clutch to hold a spring as it is stretched and relaxed
              by ankle movements when the foot is on the ground, helping to
              fulfil one function of the calf muscles and Achilles tendon.
              Unlike muscles, however, the clutch sustains force passively. The
              exoskeleton consumes no chemical or electrical energy and
              delivers no net positive mechanical work, yet reduces the
              metabolic cost of walking by 7.2 +/- 2.6\% for healthy human
              users under natural conditions, comparable to savings with
              powered devices. Improving upon walking economy in this way is
              analogous to altering the structure of the body such that it is
              more energy-effective at walking. While strong natural pressures
              have already shaped human locomotion, improvements in efficiency
              are still possible. Much remains to be learned about this
              seemingly simple behaviour.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Previous reports of the mechanics and energetics of
              post-stroke hemiparetic walking have either not combined
              estimates of mechanical and metabolic energy or computed external
              mechanical work based on the limited combined limbs method. Here
              we present a comparison of the mechanics and energetics of
              hemiparetic and unimpaired walking at a matched speed. METHODS:
              Mechanical work done on the body centre of mass (COM) was
              computed by the individual limbs method and work done at
              individual leg joints was computed with an inverse dynamics
              analysis. Both estimates were converted to average powers and
              related to simultaneous estimates of net metabolic power,
              determined via indirect calorimetry. Efficiency of positive work
              was calculated as the ratio of average positive mechanical power
              [Formula: see text] to net metabolic power. RESULTS: Total
              [Formula: see text] was 20\% greater for the hemiparetic group
              (H) than for the unimpaired control group (C) (0.49 vs. 0.41 W .

              the paretic limb of hemiparetic walkers not providing
              appropriately timed push-off [Formula: see text] in the
              step-to-step transition. This led to compensatory non-paretic
              limb hip and knee [Formula: see text] which resulted in greater
              total mechanical work. Efficiency of positive work was not
              different between H and C. CONCLUSIONS: Increased work, not
              decreased efficiency, explains the greater metabolic cost of
              hemiparetic walking post-stroke. Our results highlighted the need

  author   = "Takahashi, K Z and Lewek, M D and Sawicki, G S",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: In persons post-stroke, diminished ankle joint
              function can contribute to inadequate gait propulsion. To target
              paretic ankle impairments, we developed a neuromechanics-based
              powered ankle exoskeleton. Specifically, this exoskeleton
              supplies plantarflexion assistance that is proportional to the
              user's paretic soleus electromyography (EMG) amplitude only
              during a phase of gait when the stance limb is subjected to an
              anteriorly directed ground reaction force (GRF). The purpose of
              this feasibility study was to examine the short-term effects of
              the powered ankle exoskeleton on the mechanics and energetics of
              gait. METHODS: Five subjects with stroke walked with a powered
              ankle exoskeleton on the paretic limb for three 5 minute
              sessions. We analyzed the peak paretic ankle plantarflexion
              moment, paretic ankle positive work, symmetry of GRF propulsion
              impulse, and net metabolic power. RESULTS: The exoskeleton
              increased the paretic plantarflexion moment by 16\% during the
              powered walking trials relative to unassisted walking condition
              (p < .05). Despite this enhanced paretic ankle moment, there was
              no significant increase in paretic ankle positive work, or
              changes in any other mechanical variables with the powered
              assistance. The exoskeleton assistance appeared to reduce the net
              metabolic power gradually with each 5 minute repetition, though
              no statistical significance was found. In three of the subjects,
              the paretic soleus activation during the propulsion phase of
              stance was reduced during the powered assistance compared to
              unassisted walking (35\% reduction in the integrated EMG
              amplitude during the third powered session). CONCLUSIONS: This
              feasibility study demonstrated that the exoskeleton can enhance
              paretic ankle moment. Future studies with greater sample size and
              prolonged sessions are warranted to evaluate the effects of the
              powered ankle exoskeleton on overall gait outcomes in persons

              animals is critical for understanding muscle-tendon function,
              joint-specific contributions and energy-saving mechanisms during
              locomotion. Inverse dynamics is often employed to estimate
              joint-level contributions, and deformable body estimates can be
              used to study work performed by the foot. We recently discovered
              that these commonly used experimental estimates fail to explain
              whole-body energy changes observed during human walking. By
              re-analyzing previously published data, we found that about 25\%
              (8 J) of total positive energy changes of/about the body's
              center-of-mass and >30\% of the energy changes during the
              Push-off phase of walking were not explained by conventional
              joint- and segment-level work estimates, exposing a gap in our
              fundamental understanding of work production during gait. Here,
              we present a novel Energy-Accounting analysis that integrates
              various empirical measures of work and energy to elucidate the
              source of unexplained biomechanical work. We discovered that by
              extending conventional 3 degree-of-freedom (DOF) inverse dynamics
              (estimating rotational work about joints) to 6DOF (rotational and
              translational) analysis of the hip, knee, ankle and foot, we
              could fully explain the missing positive work. This revealed that
              Push-off work performed about the hip may be >50\% greater than
              conventionally estimated (9.3 versus 6.0 J, P=0.0002, at 1.4 m
              s(-1)). Our findings demonstrate that 6DOF analysis (of
              hip-knee-ankle-foot) better captures energy changes of the body
              than more conventional 3DOF estimates. These findings refine our
              fundamental understanding of how work is distributed within the
              body, which has implications for assistive technology,

  abstract = "Previous studies of human locomotion indicate that foot and ankle
              structures can interact in complex ways. The structure of the
              foot defines the input and output lever arms that influences the
              force-generating capacity of the ankle plantar flexors during
              push-off. At the same time, deformation of the foot may dissipate
              some of the mechanical energy generated by the plantar flexors
              during push-off. We investigated this foot-ankle interplay during
              walking by adding stiffness to the foot through shoes and
              insoles, and characterized the resulting changes in in vivo
              soleus muscle-tendon mechanics using ultrasonography. Added
              stiffness decreased energy dissipation at the foot (p < 0.001)
              and increased the gear ratio (i.e., ratio of ground reaction
              force and plantar flexor muscle lever arms) (p < 0.001). Added
              foot stiffness also altered soleus muscle behaviour, leading to
              greater peak force (p < 0.001) and reduced fascicle shortening
              speed (p < 0.001). Despite this shift in force-velocity
              behaviour, the whole-body metabolic cost during walking increased
              with added foot stiffness (p < 0.001). This increased metabolic
              cost is likely due to the added force demand on the plantar
              flexors, as walking on a more rigid foot/shoe surface compromises
              the plantar flexors' mechanical advantage.",

              imaging and physical measurements in both 3D-CT protocols. The

              epileptic foci",

  abstract = "SUMMARY: There is increasing interest in mapping and source
              reconstruction from electrocorticoencephalographic (ECoG) grid
              data and comparison to surface EEG evaluations of epileptic
              patients. ECoG mapping onto three-dimensional renderings of the
              individual cortical anatomy derived from magnetic resonance
              images and computed tomography (CT) is performed after
              coregistration of anatomical and functional coordinate systems.
              Source reconstructions from ECoG and EEG are compared using
              different source models and realistically shaped volume conductor
              models. Realistically shaped volume conductor models for EEG
              source reconstruction are a prerequisite for improved
              localization accuracy. Individual boundary element method (BEM)
              models derived from MRI represent the ``gold standard'' and can
              approximate isotropic homogeneous head compartments and thus give
              an improved description of the head shape as compared with
              classical oversimplifying spherical shell models. Anisotropic
              volume conduction properties of the bone layer or the white
              matter fibers can be described by the finite element method
              (FEM); unfortunately, these models require a huge computational
              effort and are thus not used in daily applications. To avoid this
              computational effort, head models derived from an averaged MRI
              dataset can be used. Highly refined models with a large number of
              nodes and thus better numerical accuracy can be used by this
              approach, because the setup is performed only once and the
              decomposed models or precomputed leadfield matrices are saved for
              later application. Individual image data are not at all needed,
              if an overlay of the reconstruction results with the anatomy is
              not desired. With precomputed leadfield matrices and linear
              interpolation techniques, at least standardized BEM and FEM
              volume conductor models derived from averaged MRI datasets can
              achieve the same computational speed as analytical spherical
              models. The smoothed cortical envelope is used as a realistically
              shaped single-shell volume conductor model for ECoG source
              reconstruction, whereas three-compartment BEM-models are required
              for EEG. The authors describe how to localize ECoG-grid electrode
              positions and how to segment the cortical surface from
              coregistered magnetic resonance and CT images. Landmark-based
              coregistration is performed using common fiducials in both image
              modalities. Another more promising automatic approach is based on
              mutual three-dimensional volume gray-level information. The ECoG
              electrode positions can be retrieved from three-dimensional CT
              slices manually using cursors in thresholded images with depth
              information. Alternatively, the smoothed envelope of the cortical
              surface segmented from the MRI is used to semiautomatically
              determine the grid electrode positions by marking the four
              corners and measuring distances along the smoothed surface. With
              extended source patches for cortically constrained scans and
              current density reconstructions, results from ECoG and surface
              EEG data were compared. Single equivalent dipoles were used to
              explain the EEG far fields, and results were compared with the
              original current density distributions explaining the ECoG data.
              The authors studied the performance of spherical and
              realistically shaped BEM volume conductor models for EEG and ECoG
              source reconstruction in spherical and nonspherical parts of the
              head with simulations and measured epileptic spike data. Only
              small differences between spherical and realistically shaped
              models were found in the spherical parts of the head, whereas
              realistically shaped models are superior to spherical
              approximations in both single-shell ECoG and three-shell EEG
              cases in the nonspherical parts, such as the temporal lobe areas.
              The ECoG near field is more complicated to interpret than the
              surface EEG far field and cannot be explained in general by
              simple equivalent dipoles. However, from simulations with
              realistically shaped volume conductor models and cortically
              constrained source models, the authors studied how the bone and
              skin layer act as spatial low pass filters that smooth and
              simplify the surface EEG maps generated by much more
              complicated-looking source configurations derived from measured
              ECoG data.",

  abstract = "AIM OF THE STUDY: An important goal for EEG-based functional
              brain studies is to estimate the location of brain sources that
              produce the scalp-recorded signals. Such source localization
              requires locating precisely the position of the EEG sensors. This
              review describes and compares different methods that are used for
              localizing EEG sensors. RESULTS: Five different methods have been
              described in literature. Manual methods consist in manual
              measurements to calculate the 3D coordinates of the sensors.
              Electromagnetic and ultrasound digitization permit localization
              by using trade devices. The photogrammetry system consists in
              taking pictures of the patient's head with the sensors. The last
              method consists in directly localizing the EEG sensors in the MRI
              volume. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The spatial localization of
              EEG sensors is an important step in performing source
              localization. This method should be accurate, fast, reproducible,
              and cheap. Currently, electromagnetic digitization is the most
              currently used method but MRI localization could be an
              interesting way because no additional method or device needs to
              be used to locate the EEG sensors.",

              description of the inverse problem and proceeds to discuss the
              two main categories of methods which were developed to solve the
              EEG inverse problem, mainly the non parametric and parametric
              methods. The main difference between the two is to whether a
              fixed number of dipoles is assumed a priori or not. Various
              techniques falling within these categories are described
              including minimum norm estimates and their generalizations,

              such as MUSIC and methods derived from it, FINES, simulated
              annealing and computational intelligence algorithms for
              parametric methods. From a review of the performance of these
              techniques as documented in the literature, one could conclude
              that in most cases the LORETA solution gives satisfactory
              results. In situations involving clusters of dipoles, higher
              resolution algorithms such as MUSIC or FINES are however
              preferred. Imposing reliable biophysical and psychological
              constraints, as done by LAURA has given superior results. The
              Monte-Carlo analysis performed, comparing WMN, LORETA, sLORETA
              and SLF, for different noise levels and different simulated
              source depths has shown that for single source localization,
              regularized sLORETA gives the best solution in terms of both
              localization error and ghost sources. Furthermore the
              computationally intensive solution given by SLF was not found to
              give any additional benefits under such simulated conditions.",

              influencing the spatial precision and the replicability of
              electromagnetic trackers (EMT) for the localization of electrodes
              and natural landmarks on the patient's head. MATERIALS AND
              METHODS: The effects of seven conditions on the measurement of
              the EMT were investigated with a Polhemus Fastrack: distance,
              contact between two components of the EMT, presence of magnetic
              object, localization of landmarks and electrodes on a phantom and
              a human subject without and with movements. RESULTS: The EMT has
              a precision of 0.15mm+/-0.36mm for the measurements made on still
              objects in a non-magnetic environment. On a human subject, the
              mean variation of the nasion position is 1.6mm+/-1.46mm and
              2.7mm+/-1.40mm for the tragus. The increase of the electrode
              measurement dispersions is significant between the phantom and
              the human subject with a mean variation of 2.39mm+/-1.26mm. In
              certain conditions, up to 15\% of the measurements may be

              magnetoencephalography has provided important new insights into
              brain physiology and pathology. Here we assess whether valid
              localizations of coherent cortical networks can also be obtained
              from high-resolution electroencephalography (EEG) recordings.
              METHODS: EEG was recorded from healthy subjects and from patients
              with ischemic brain lesions during a tonic hand muscle
              contraction task and during continuous visual stimulation with an
              alternating checkerboard. These tasks induce oscillations in the
              primary hand motor area or in the primary visual cortex,
              respectively, which are coherent with extracerebral signals (hand
              muscle electromyogram or visual stimulation frequency). Cortical
              oscillations were reconstructed with different inverse solutions
              and the coherence between oscillations at each cortical voxel and
              the extracerebral signals was calculated. Moreover, simulations
              of coherent point sources were performed. RESULTS:
              Cortico-muscular coherence was correctly localized to the primary
              hand motor area and the steady-state visual evoked potentials to
              the primary visual cortex in all subjects and patients.
              Sophisticated head models tended to yield better localization
              accuracy than a single sphere model. A Minimum Variance
              Beamformer (MVBF) provided more accurate and focal localizations
              of simulated point sources than an L2 Minimum Norm (MN) inverse
              solution. In the real datasets, the MN maps had less localization
              error but were less focal than MVBF maps. CONCLUSIONS: EEG can
              localize coherent cortical networks with sufficient accuracy.",

              electroencephalogram (EEG) have been assumed dipolar in nature.
              In this study, we used electrophysiological recordings from
              anesthetized Wistar rats undergoing repeated whisker deflections
              to revise the biophysical foundations of the EEG dipolar model.
              In a first experiment, we performed three-dimensional recordings
              of extracellular potentials from a large portion of the barrel
              field to estimate intracortical multipolar moments generated
              either by single spiking neurons (i.e., pyramidal cells, PC;
              spiny stellate cells, SS) or by populations of them while
              experiencing synchronized postsynaptic potentials. As expected,
              backpropagating spikes along PC dendrites caused dipolar field
              components larger in the direction perpendicular to the cortical
              surface (49.7 +/- 22.0 nA.mm). In agreement with the fact that SS
              cells have ``close-field'' configurations, their dipolar moment
              at any direction was negligible. Surprisingly, monopolar field
              components were detectable both at the level of single units
              (i.e., -11.7 +/- 3.4 nA for PC) and at the mesoscopic level of
              mixed neuronal populations receiving extended synaptic inputs
              within either a cortical column (-0.44 +/- 0.20 muA) or a
              2.5-m(3)-voxel volume (-3.32 +/- 1.20 muA). To evaluate the
              relationship between the macroscopically defined EEG equivalent
              dipole and the mesoscopic intracortical multipolar moments, we
              performed concurrent recordings of high-resolution skull EEG and
              laminar local field potentials. From this second experiment, we
              estimated the time-varying EEG equivalent dipole for the entire
              barrel field using either a multiple dipole fitting or a
              distributed type of EEG inverse solution. We demonstrated that
              mesoscopic multipolar components are altogether absorbed by any
              equivalent dipole in both types of inverse solutions. We conclude
              that the primary current sources of the EEG in the neocortex of
              rodents are not precisely represented by a single equivalent
              dipole and that the existence of monopolar components must be
              also considered at the mesoscopic level.",

              established by placing the cap on a reference head and digitizing

              error would lead only to displacement of localized sources. Here,
              we measured electrode positions on a 3D-printed full-scale
              replica head, using three different techniques: a fringe
              projection 3D scanner, a novel ``Flying Triangulation'' 3D
              sensor, and a traditional electromagnetic digitizer. Using highly
              accurate fringe projection data as ground truth, the Flying

              degradation of beamformer performance, with output SNR penalties

  abstract = "Electroencephalography (EEG) is often used in source analysis
              studies, in which the locations of cortex regions responsible for
              a signal are determined. For this to be possible, accurate
              positions of the electrodes at the scalp surface must be
              determined, otherwise errors in the source estimation will occur.
              Today, several methods for acquiring these positions exist but
              they are often not satisfyingly accurate or take a long time to
              perform. Therefore, in this paper we describe a method capable of
              determining the positions accurately and fast. This method uses
              an infrared light motion capture system (IR-MOCAP) with 8 cameras
              arranged around a human participant. It acquires 3D coordinates
              of each electrode and automatically labels them. Each electrode
              has a small reflector on top of it thus allowing its detection by
              the cameras. We tested the accuracy of the presented method by
              acquiring the electrodes positions on a rigid sphere model and
              comparing these with measurements from computer tomography (CT).
              The average Euclidean distance between the sphere model CT
              measurements and the presented method was 1.23 mm with an average
              standard deviation of 0.51 mm. We also tested the method with a
              human participant. The measurement was quickly performed and all
              positions were captured. These results tell that, with this
              method, it is possible to acquire electrode positions with
              minimal error and little time effort for the study participants

              sufficient sampling of the surface potential field, an accurate
              conducting volume estimation (head model), and a suitable and
              well-understood inverse technique. The goal of the present study
              is to examine the effect of sampling density and coverage on the
              ability to accurately localize sources, using common linear
              inverse weight techniques, at different depths. Several inverse
              methods are examined, using the popular head conductivity. NEW
              METHOD: Simulation studies were employed to examine the effect of
              spatial sampling of the potential field at the head surface, in
              terms of sensor density and coverage of the inferior and superior
              head regions. In addition, the effects of sensor density and
              coverage are investigated in the source localization of

              localization accuracy. Moreover, across all sampling density and

              the accuracy of source estimates at all depths. COMPARISON WITH

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Source localization algorithms often show multiple
              active cortical areas as the source of electroencephalography
              (EEG). Yet, there is little data quantifying the accuracy of
              these results. In this paper, the performance of current source
              density source localization algorithms for the detection of
              multiple cortical sources of EEG data has been characterized.
              METHODS: EEG data were generated by simulating multiple cortical
              sources (2-4) with the same strength or two sources with relative
              strength ratios of 1:1 to 4:1, and adding noise. These data were
              used to reconstruct the cortical sources using current source
              density (CSD) algorithms: sLORETA, MNLS, and LORETA using a
              p-norm with p equal to 1, 1.5 and 2. Precision (percentage of the
              reconstructed activity corresponding to simulated activity) and
              Recall (percentage of the simulated sources reconstructed) of
              each of the CSD algorithms were calculated. RESULTS: While
              sLORETA has the best performance when only one source is present,
              when two or more sources are present LORETA with p equal to 1.5
              performs better. When the relative strength of one of the sources
              is decreased, all algorithms have more difficulty reconstructing
              that source. However, LORETA 1.5 continues to outperform other
              algorithms. If only the strongest source is of interest sLORETA
              is recommended, while LORETA with p equal to 1.5 is recommended
              if two or more of the cortical sources are of interest. These
              results provide guidance for choosing a CSD algorithm to locate
              multiple cortical sources of EEG and for interpreting the results
              of these algorithms.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Accurate knowledge about the positions of electrodes
              in electroencephalography (EEG) is very important for precise
              source localizations. Direct detection of electrodes from
              magnetic resonance (MR) images is particularly interesting, as it
              is possible to avoid errors of co-registration between electrode
              and head coordinate systems. In this study, we propose an
              automated MR-based method for electrode detection and labeling,
              particularly tailored to high-density montages. APPROACH:
              Anatomical MR images were processed to create an
              electrode-enhanced image in individual space. Image processing
              included intensity non-uniformity correction, background noise
              and goggles artifact removal. Next, we defined a search volume
              around the head where electrode positions were detected.
              Electrodes were identified as local maxima in the search volume
              and registered to the Montreal Neurological Institute standard
              space using an affine transformation. This allowed the matching
              of the detected points with the specific EEG montage template, as
              well as their labeling. Matching and labeling were performed by
              the coherent point drift method. Our method was assessed on 8 MR
              images collected in subjects wearing a 256-channel EEG net, using
              the displacement with respect to manually selected electrodes as
              performance metric. MAIN RESULTS: Average displacement achieved
              by our method was significantly lower compared to alternative
              techniques, such as the photogrammetry technique. The maximum
              displacement was for more than 99\% of the electrodes lower than
              1 cm, which is typically considered an acceptable upper limit for
              errors in electrode positioning. Our method showed robustness and
              reliability, even in suboptimal conditions, such as in the case
              of net rotation, imprecisely gathered wires, electrode detachment
              from the head, and MR image ghosting. SIGNIFICANCE: We showed
              that our method provides objective, repeatable and precise
              estimates of EEG electrode coordinates. We hope our work will
              contribute to a more widespread use of high-density EEG as a
              brain-imaging tool.",

              recording electrodes. The prevailing technique for registering
              EEG electrode coordinates involves electromagnetic digitization.
              However, the procedure adds several minutes to experiment
              preparation and typical digitizers may not be accurate enough for
              optimal source reconstruction performance (Dalal et al., 2014).
              Here, we present a rapid, accurate, and cost-effective
              alternative method to register EEG electrode positions, using a
              single digital SLR camera, photogrammetry software, and computer
              vision techniques implemented in our open-source toolbox,
              janus3D. Our approach uses photogrammetry to construct 3D models
              from multiple photographs of the participant's head wearing the
              EEG electrode cap. Electrodes are detected automatically or
              semi-automatically using a template. The rigid facial features
              from these photo-based models are then surface-matched to
              MRI-based head reconstructions to facilitate coregistration to
              MRI space. This method yields a final electrode coregistration
              error of 0.8 mm, while a standard technique using an
              electromagnetic digitizer yielded an error of 6.1 mm. The
              technique furthermore reduces preparation time, and could be
              extended to a multi-camera array, which would make the procedure
              virtually instantaneous. In addition to EEG, the technique could
              likewise capture the position of the fiducial markers used in
              magnetoencephalography systems to register head position.",

              For subsequent procedures, the laser scan is conducted likewise

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: In longitudinal electroencephalography (EEG) studies,
              repeatable electrode positioning is essential for reliable EEG
              assessment. Conventional methods use anatomical landmarks as
              fiducial locations for the electrode placement. Since the
              landmarks are manually identified, the EEG assessment is
              inevitably unreliable because of individual variations among the
              subjects and the examiners. To overcome this unreliability, an
              augmented reality (AR) visualization-based electrode guidance
              system was proposed. METHODS: The proposed electrode guidance
              system is based on AR visualization to replace the manual
              electrode positioning. After scanning and registration of the
              facial surface of a subject by an RGB-D camera, the AR of the
              initial electrode positions as reference positions is overlapped
              with the current electrode positions in real time. Thus, it can

              These measurements have been extremely time consuming because of
              the difficulty in obtaining repeatable constant speed trials
              (particularly with animals). We have overcome this difficulty by

              from an unlimited number of successive ground contacts in a much

              possible to accurately make the following measurements over the

  abstract = "In human walking, the center of mass motion is similar to an
              inverted pendulum. Viewing double support as a transition from
              one inverted pendulum to the next, we hypothesized that the
              leading leg performs negative work to redirect the center of mass
              velocity, while simultaneously, the trailing leg performs
              positive work to replace the lost energy. To test this
              hypothesis, we developed a method to quantify the external
              mechanical work performed by each limb (individual limbs method).
              Traditional measures of external mechanical work use the sum of
              the ground reaction forces acting on the limbs (combined limbs
              method) allowing for the mathematical cancellation of
              simultaneous positive and negative work during multiple support

              a simple inverted pendulum model, an extension of this rule is
              proposed for dynamical situations: the position of (the vertical

  author   = "O'Connor, S M and Kuo, A D",
  abstract = "Human walking has previously been described as ``controlled
              falling.'' Some computational models, however, suggest that gait
              may also have self-stabilizing aspects requiring little CNS
              control. The fore-aft component of walking may even be passively
              stable from step to step, whereas lateral motion may be unstable
              and require motor control for balance, as through active foot
              placement. If this is the case, walking humans might rely less on
              integrative sensory feedback, such as vision, for anteroposterior
              (AP) than for mediolateral (ML) balance. We tested whether
              healthy humans (n=10) exhibit such direction-dependent control,
              by applying low-frequency perturbations to the visual field (a
              projected virtual hallway) and measuring foot placement during
              treadmill walking. We found step variability to be nearly 10
              times more sensitive to ML than to AP perturbations, as
              quantified by the increase in root-mean-square step variability
              per unit change in perturbation amplitude. This is not simply due
              to poorer physiological sensitivity of vision in the AP
              direction: similar perturbations applied to quiet standing
              produced reversed direction dependence, with an AP sensitivity
              2.3-fold greater than that of ML. Tandem (heel-to-toe) standing
              yielded ML sensitivity threefold greater than that of AP,
              suggesting that the base of support influences the stability of
              standing. Postural balance nevertheless appears to require
              continuous, integrative motor control for balance in all
              directions. In contrast, walking balance requires step-by-step,
              integrative control for balance, but mainly in the lateral
              direction. In the fore-aft direction, balance may be maintained
              through an ``uncontrolled,'' yet passively stabilized, series of

  author   = "Malone, L A and Bastian, A J",
  abstract = "Control of the human walking pattern normally requires little
              thought, with conscious control used only in the face of a
              challenging environment or a perturbation. We have previously
              shown that people can adapt spatial and temporal aspects of
              walking to a sustained perturbation generated by a split-belt
              treadmill. Here we tested whether conscious correction of
              walking, versus distraction from it, modifies adaptation.
              Conscious correction of stepping may expedite the adaptive
              process and help to form a new walking pattern. However, because
              walking is normally an automatic process, it is possible that
              conscious effort could interfere with adaptation, whereas
              distraction might improve it by removing competing voluntary
              control. Three groups of subjects were studied: a control group
              was given no specific instructions, a conscious correction group
              was instructed how to step and given intermittent visual feedback
              of stepping during adaptation, and a distraction group performed
              a dual-task during adaptation. After adaptation, retention of
              aftereffects was assessed in all groups during normal treadmill
              walking without conscious effort, feedback, or distraction. We
              found that conscious correction speeds adaptation, whereas
              distraction slows it. Subjects trained with distraction retained
              aftereffects longest, suggesting that the training used during
              adaptation predicts the time course of deadaptation. An
              unexpected finding was that these manipulations affected the
              adaptation rate of spatial but not temporal elements of walking.
              Thus conscious processes can preferentially access the spatial
              walking pattern. It may be that spatial and temporal controls of
              locomotion are accessible through distinct neural circuits, with
              the former being most sensitive to conscious effort or

  abstract = "In walking, humans prefer a moderate step width that minimizes
              energetic cost and vary step width from step-to-step to maintain
              lateral balance. Arm swing also reduces energetic cost and
              improves lateral balance. In running, humans prefer a narrow step
              width that may present a challenge for maintaining lateral
              balance. However, arm swing in running may improve lateral
              balance and help reduce energetic cost. To understand the roles
              of step width and arm swing, we hypothesized that net metabolic
              power would be greater at step widths greater or less than
              preferred and when running without arm swing. We further
              hypothesized that step width variability (indicator of lateral
              balance) would be greater at step widths greater or less than
              preferred and when running without arm swing. Ten subjects ran
              (3m/s) at four target step widths (0\%, 15\%, 20\%, and 25\% leg
              length (LL)) with arm swing, at their preferred step width with
              arm swing, and at their preferred step width without arm swing.
              We measured metabolic power, step width, and step width
              variability. When subjects ran at target step widths less (0\%
              LL) or greater (15\%, 20\%, and 25\% LL) than preferred, both net
              metabolic power demand (by 3\%, 9\%, 12\%, and 15\%) and step
              width variability (by 7\%, 33\%, 46\%, and 69\%) increased. When
              running without arm swing, both net metabolic power demand (by
              8\%) and step width variability (by 9\%) increased compared to
              running with arm swing. It appears that humans prefer to run with

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Understanding how stability and/or maneuverability
              affects motor control strategies can provide insight on moving
              about safely in an unpredictable world. Stability in human
              movement has been well-studied while maneuverability has not.
              Further, a tradeoff between stability and maneuverability during
              movement seems apparent, yet has not been quantified. We proposed
              that greater maneuverability, the ability to rapidly and
              purposefully change movement direction and speed, is beneficial
              in uncertain environments. We also hypothesized that gaining
              maneuverability comes at the expense of stability and perhaps
              also corresponds with decreased muscle coactivation. MATERIALS
              AND METHODS: We used a goal-directed forward lean movement task
              that integrated both stability and maneuverability. Subjects (n =
              11) used their center of pressure to control a cursor on a
              computer monitor to reach a target. We added task uncertainty by
              shifting the target anterior-posterior position mid-movement. We
              used a balance board with a narrow beam that reduced the base of
              support in the medio-lateral direction and defined stability as
              the probability that subjects could keep the balance board level
              during the task. RESULTS: During the uncertainty condition,
              subjects were able to change direction of their
              anterior-posterior center of pressure more rapidly, indicating
              that subjects were more maneuverable. Furthermore, medio-lateral
              center of pressure excursions also approached the edges of the
              beam and reduced stability margins, implying that subjects were
              less stable (i.e. less able to keep the board level). On the
              narrow beam board, subjects increased muscle coactivation of
              lateral muscle pairs and had greater muscle activity in the left
              leg. However, there were no statistically significant differences
              in muscle activity amplitudes or coactivation with uncertainty.
              CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results demonstrate that there is
              a tradeoff between stability and maneuverability during a
              goal-directed whole-body movement. Tasks with added uncertainty
              could help individuals learn to be more maneuverable yet
              sufficiently stable.",

              Mean MOS(ml) were consistently slightly larger during all

  abstract = "The Nintendo Wii Balance Board (WBB) is increasingly used as an
              inexpensive force plate for assessment of postural control;
              however, no documentation of force and COP accuracy and
              reliability is publicly available. Therefore, we performed a
              standard measurement uncertainty analysis on 3 lightly and 6
              heavily used WBBs to provide future users with information about
              the repeatability and accuracy of the WBB force and COP
              measurements. Across WBBs, we found the total uncertainty of
              force measurements to be within +/- 9.1N, and of COP location
              within +/- 4.1mm. However, repeatability of a single measurement
              within a board was better (4.5 N, 1.5mm), suggesting that the WBB
              is best used for relative measures using the same device, rather
              than absolute measurement across devices. Internally stored
              calibration values were comparable to those determined
              experimentally. Further, heavy wear did not significantly degrade
              performance. In combination with prior evaluation of WBB
              performance and published standards for measuring human balance,
              our study provides necessary information to evaluate the use of
              the WBB for analysis of human balance control. We suggest the WBB
              may be useful for low-resolution measurements, but should not be
              considered as a replacement for laboratory-grade force plates.",

              or off status of visual stimulus",
  author   = "Yotani, K and Nakamoto, H and Ikudome, S and Yuki, A",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether response time is affected by a
              stimulus cue, such as a light turned on or off, or if there are
              differences in response to these cues during a muscle contraction
              task compared with a muscle relaxation task. The objective of
              this study was to assess the response time of a relaxation task,
              including the contraction portion of the task, to a stimulus of a
              light turned on or off. In addition, we investigated the effect
              of the pre-contraction level on the relaxation task. RESULTS:
              Contraction response time was significantly shorter during the
              light-on status than during the light-off status (P <0.01), and
              relaxation response time in each maximum voluntary contraction
              was significantly longer during the light-on status than during
              the light-off status (P <0.01). The relaxation response time
              became longer in order of 25\% to 75\% maximum voluntary
              contraction regardless of light-on or -off status, and was
              significantly longer than the contraction response time (P
              <0.05-0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study found that as the
              contraction level increased, the relaxation response time became
              longer than the contraction response time regardless of light
              status. However, contraction response time or relaxation response
              time findings were opposite to this during the light-on status
              and light-off status: contraction response time became shorter in
              the light-on status than in the light-off status and relaxation
              response time became longer in the light-on status than in the
              light-off status. These results suggest that the length of each
              response time is affected by motor control in the higher order
              brain and involves specific processing in the visual system.",

              electroencephalography (EEG) to measure electrocortical dynamics

              artifacts corrupt the EEG and mask underlying neural signals of
              interest. The cause of motion artifacts in EEG is often
              attributed to electrode motion relative to the skin, but few
              studies have examined EEG signals under head motion. In the
              current study, we tested how motion artifacts are affected by the
              overall mass and surface area of commercially available
              electrodes, as well as how cable sway contributes to motion
              artifacts. To provide a ground-truth signal, we used a gelatin
              head phantom with embedded antennas broadcasting electrical
              signals, and recorded EEG with a commercially available electrode
              system. A robotic platform moved the phantom head through
              sinusoidal displacements at different frequencies (0-2 Hz).
              Results showed that a larger electrode surface area can have a
              small but significant effect on improving EEG signal quality
              during motion and that cable sway is a major contributor to
              motion artifacts. These results have implications in the
