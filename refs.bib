               theories. Age-related atrophy of the motor cortical regions and
               corpus callosum may precipitate or coincide with motor declines
               such as balance and gait deficits, coordination deficits, and
               movement slowing. Correspondingly, degeneration of
               neurotransmitter systems-primarily the dopaminergic system-may
               contribute to age-related gross and fine motor declines, as well
               as to higher cognitive deficits. In general, older adults
               exhibit involvement of more widespread brain regions for motor
               control than young adults, particularly the prefrontal cortex
               and basal ganglia networks. Unfortunately these same regions are
               the most vulnerable to age-related effects, resulting in an
               imbalance of ``supply and demand''. Existing exercise,

              unknown. Our previous study showed that the primary motor cortex
              may contribute to specific requirements of walking (i.e.,
              maintaining a constant movement frequency and bilaterally
              coordinating the feet). Because aging can impair (i) the ability
              to fulfill the aforementioned requirements and (ii)
              corticomuscular communication, we hypothesized that aging would
              impair the motoneuronal recruitment by the primary motor cortex
              during bilateral cyclical movements. Here, we used
              corticomuscular coherence (i.e., coherence between the primary
              motor cortex and the active muscles) to examine whether
              corticomuscular communication is affected in older individuals
              during cyclical movements that shared some functional
              requirements with walking. Fifteen young men and 9 older men
              performed cyclical, anti-phasic dorsiflexion and plantarflexion
              of the feet while seated. Coherence between the midline primary
              motor cortex and contracting leg muscles cyclically increased in
              both age groups. However, the coherence of older participants was
              characterized by (i) lower magnitude and (ii) mediolaterally
              broader and more rostrally centered cortical distributions. These
              characteristics suggest that aging changes how the primary motor

              in EEG-based emotion decoding using supervised machine learning

              decomposition approaches to investigate the underlying EEG
              dynamics by characterizing brain temporal dynamics during
              emotional experience. This study applies an unsupervised approach
              -- adaptive mixture independent component analysis (adaptive
              mixture ICA, AMICA) that learns a set of ICA models each
              accounted for portions of a given multi-channel EEG recording. We
              demonstrate that 20-model AMICA decomposition can identify
              distinct EEG patterns or dynamic states active during each of the
              fifteen emotion-imagery periods. The transition in EEG patterns
              revealed the time-courses of brain-state dynamics during
              emotional imagery. These time-courses varied across emotions:
              ``grief'' and ``happiness'' showed more abrupt transitions while
              ``contentment'' was nearly indistinguishable from the preceding
              rest period. The spatial distributions of independent components
              (ICs) of the AMICA models showed higher similarity within-subject
              across emotions than within-emotion across subjects. No
              significant differences in IC distributions were found between
              positive and negative emotions. However, significant changes in
              IC distributions during emotional imagery compared to rest were
              identified in brain areas such as the left prefrontal cortex, the
              posterior cingulate cortex, the motor cortex, and the visual
              cortex. The study demonstrates the feasibility of AMICA in
              modeling high-density and nonstationary EEG and its utility in
              providing data-driven insights into brain state dynamics during
              self-paced emotional experiences, which have been difficult to
              measure. This approach can advance our understanding of highly

               recent articles on the topic of non-invasive hBCIs, to
               comprehensively identify the current trends, limitations and
               challenges that these studies report. Methods. Three major
               databases covering the ?elds of science and engineering were
               queried. From these and others sources, 55 journal articles from
               2008 to November 2014 were selected and analyzed. Results.
               Twenty-two items were investigated to offer a complete
               perspective on the current state of non-invasive hBCI research
               in humans, covering the study rationale, experimental protocol,
               signal-processing methodology, and system evaluation. Based on
               this analysis, recommendations were formulated to direct further
               work in the ?eld. Signi?cance. We hope this review will
               constitute the groundwork for future hBCI studies.",

  abstract = "Age-related brain changes likely contribute to mobility
              impairments, but the specific mechanisms are poorly understood.
              Current brain measurement approaches (e.g., functional magnetic
              resonance imaging (fMRI), functional near infrared spectroscopy
              (fNIRS), PET) are limited by inability to measure activity from
              the whole brain during walking. The Mind in Motion Study will use
              cutting edge, mobile, high-density electroencephalography (EEG).
              This approach relies upon innovative hardware and software to
              deliver three-dimensional localization of active cortical and
              subcortical regions with good spatial and temporal resolution
              during walking. Our overarching objective is to determine
              age-related changes in the central neural control of walking and
              correlate these findings with a comprehensive set of mobility
              outcomes (clinic-based, complex walking, and community mobility
              measures). Our hypothesis is that age-related walking deficits
              are explained in part by the Compensation Related Utilization of
              Neural Circuits Hypothesis (CRUNCH). CRUNCH is a well-supported
              model that describes the over-recruitment of brain regions
              exhibited by older adults in comparison to young adults, even at
              low levels of task complexity. CRUNCH also describes the limited
              brain reserve resources available with aging. These factors cause
              older adults to quickly reach a ceiling in brain resources when
              performing tasks of increasing complexity, leading to poor
              performance. Two hundred older adults and twenty young adults
              will undergo extensive baseline neuroimaging and walking
              assessments. Older adults will subsequently be followed for up to
              3 years. Aim 1 will evaluate whether brain activity during actual
              walking explains mobility decline. Cross sectional and
              longitudinal designs will be used to study whether poorer walking
              performance and steeper trajectories of decline are associated
              with CRUNCH indices. Aim 2 is to harmonize high-density EEG
              during walking with fNIRS (during actual and imagined walking)
              and fMRI (during imagined walking). This will allow integration
              of CRUNCH-related hallmarks of brain activity across neuroimaging
              modalities, which is expected to lead to more widespread
              application of study findings. Aim 3 will study central and
              peripheral mechanisms (e.g., cerebral blood flow, brain regional
              volumes, and connectivity, sensory function) to explain
              differences in CRUNCH indices during walking. Research performed
              in the Mind in Motion Study will comprehensively characterize the
              aging brain during walking for developing new intervention
              targets.",

               uncertainty characteristics of individual independent component
               (IC) maps returned by the AMICA decomposition [1], we used the
               RELICA (Bootstrap-ICA) toolbox [2] to generate 50 decompositions
               of bootstrap resampled versions of the same EEG data set. This
               allows identification of clusters of near-identical bootstrap

              movement kinematics while participants perform demanding
              perceptual and cognitive tasks in a naturalistic environment. A
              typical MoBI setup involves positioning multi-channel electrode
              caps based on anatomical fiducials as well as experimenter and
              participant intuition regarding the scalp midpoint location
              (i.e., Cz). Researchers often use the ``template'' electrode
              locations provided by the manufacturer, however, the ``actual''
              electrode locations can vary based on each participant's head
              morphology. Accounting for differences in head morphologies could

              MoBI to identify neurological deficits in patients with motor,

              electrode locations were estimated using spherical or ellipsoid
              models. We identified differences in event-related potentials
              between ``template'' and ``actual'' electrode locations during a
              Go/No-Go task (p < 9.8e-5) and an object-manipulation task (p <
              9.8e-5). Thus, the motion capture system already used in MoBI
              experiments can be effectively deployed to accurately register
              and quantify the neural activity. Improving the spatial
              localization without needing specialized hardware or additional
              setup time to the workflow has important real-world implications

              plasticity, or learning from repetition, plays an important role
              in shaping motor behaviors. Yet the impact of repetition on
              locomotor learning is unclear, despite the fact that gait is
              developed and practiced over millions of repetitions. To test
              whether repetition alone can induce storage of a novel walking
              pattern, we instructed two groups of young healthy subjects to
              learn an asymmetric walking pattern through two distinct learning
              paradigms. The first group learned a new pattern through an
              established visual distortion paradigm, which provided both
              sensory prediction error and repetition of movement patterns to
              induce walking aftereffects, and the second received veridical
              feedback with a target change, which provided only repetition
              (use-dependent plasticity) to induce aftereffects. When feedback
              was removed, both groups demonstrated aftereffects in the primary
              outcome, step asymmetry index. Surprisingly, despite the
              different task demands, both groups produced similar aftereffect
              magnitudes, which also had similar rates of decay, suggesting
              that the addition of sensory prediction errors did not improve
              storage of learning beyond that induced by the use-dependent
              process alone. To further characterize the use-dependent process,
              we conducted a second experiment to quantify aftereffect size in
              a third group who practiced double the asymmetry magnitude. This
              new group showed a proportionately greater magnitude of the
              use-dependent aftereffect. Together, these findings show that the
              primary driver of storage of a new step length asymmetry during
              visually guided locomotor learning is repetition, not sensory
              prediction error, and this effect scales with the learning
              magnitude.NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Use-dependent plasticity, or learning
              from repetition, is an important process for upper extremity
              reaching tasks, but its contribution to walking is not well
              established. Here, we demonstrate the existence of a
              dose-dependent, use-dependent process during visually guided
              treadmill walking. We also show that sensory prediction errors,
              previously thought to drive aftereffects in similar locomotor
              learning paradigms, do not appear to play a significant role in
              visually driven learning of a novel step asymmetry during
              treadmill walking.",

               addressed. While it is not possible to determine how biological
               biped systems guarantee stability, robot solutions can be useful
               to propose new hypotheses for biology. In the second part of
               this review, the focus is on gait perturbations, which is an
               important topic in robotics in view of the frequent falls of
               robots when faced with perturbations. From the human physiology
               it is known that the initial reaction often consists of a brief
               interruption followed by an adequate response. For instance, the
               successful recovery from a trip is achieved using some basic
               reactions (termed elevating and lowering strategies), that
               depend on the phase of the step cycle of the trip occurrence.
               Reactions to stepping unexpectedly in a hole depend on comparing
               expected and real feedback. Implementation of these ideas in
               models and robotics starts to emerge, with the most advanced
               robots being able to learn how to fall safely and how to deal
               with complicated disturbances such as provided by walking on a
               split-belt.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Back pain patients (BPP) show delayed muscle onset,
               increased co-contractions, and variability as response to
               quasi-static sudden trunk loading in comparison to healthy
               controls (H). However, it is unclear whether these results can
               validly be transferred to suddenly applied walking
               perturbations, an automated but more functional and complex
               movement pattern. There is an evident need to develop
               research-based strategies for the rehabilitation of back pain.
               Therefore, the investigation of differences in trunk stability
               between H and BPP in functional movements is of primary interest
               in order to define suitable intervention regimes. The purpose of
               this study was to analyse neuromuscular reflex activity as well
               as three-dimensional trunk kinematics between H and BPP during
               walking perturbations. METHODS: Eighty H
               (31m/49f;29$\pm$9yrs;174$\pm$10cm;71$\pm$13kg) and 14 BPP
               (6m/8f;30$\pm$8yrs;171$\pm$10cm;67$\pm$14kg) walked (1m/s) on a
               split-belt treadmill while 15 right-sided perturbations (belt
               decelerating, 40m/s2, 50ms duration; 200ms after heel contact)
               were randomly applied. Trunk muscle activity was assessed using
               a 12-lead EMG set-up. Trunk kinematics were measured using a
               3-segment-model consisting of 12 markers (upper thoracic (UTA),
               lower thoracic (LTA), lumbar area (LA)). EMG-RMS ([\%],0-200ms
               after perturbation) was calculated and normalized to the RMS of
               unperturbed gait. Latency (TON;ms) and time to maximum activity
               (TMAX;ms) were analysed. Total motion amplitude (ROM;[°]) and
               mean angle (Amean;[°]) for extension-flexion, lateral flexion
               and rotation were calculated (whole stride cycle; 0-200ms after
               perturbation) for each of the three segments during unperturbed
               and perturbed gait. For ROM only, perturbed was normalized to
               unperturbed step [\%] for the whole stride as well as the 200ms
               after perturbation. Data were analysed descriptively followed by
               a student´s t-test to account for group differences.
               Co-contraction was analyzed between ventral and dorsal muscles
               (V:R) as well as side right:side left ratio (Sright:Sleft). The
               coefficient of variation (CV;\%) was calculated (EMG-RMS;ROM) to
               evaluate variability between the 15 perturbations for all
               groups. With respect to unequal distribution of participants to
               groups, an additional matched-group analysis was conducted.
               Fourteen healthy controls out of group H were sex-, age- and
               anthropometrically matched (group Hmatched) to the BPP. RESULTS:
               No group differences were observed for EMG-RMS or CV analysis
               (EMG/ROM) (p>0.025). Co-contraction analysis revealed no
               differences for V:R and Srigth:Sleft between the groups
               (p>0.025). BPP showed an increased TON and TMAX, being
               significant for Mm. rectus abdominus (p = 0.019) and erector
               spinae T9/L3 (p = 0.005/p = 0.015). ROM analysis over the
               unperturbed stride cycle revealed no differences between groups
               (p>0.025). Normalization of perturbed to unperturbed step lead
               to significant differences for the lumbar segment (LA) in
               lateral flexion with BPP showing higher normalized ROM compared
               to Hmatched (p = 0.02). BPP showed a significant higher flexed
               posture (UTA (p = 0.02); LTA (p = 0.004)) during normal walking
               (Amean). Trunk posture (Amean) during perturbation showed higher
               trunk extension values in LTA segments for H/Hmatched compared
               to BPP (p = 0.003). Matched group (BPP vs. Hmatched) analysis
               did not show any systematic changes of all results between
               groups. CONCLUSION: BPP present impaired muscle response times
               and trunk posture, especially in the sagittal and transversal
               planes, compared to H. This could indicate reduced trunk
               stability and higher loading during gait perturbations.",

  abstract  = "Advancing age affects gait adaptability, but it is unclear if
               such adaptations to split-belt perturbations are already
               affected at middle-age. Changes in neuromuscular control, that
               already start at middle-age, may underlie the age-related
               changes in gait adaptation. Thus, we examined the effects of age
               on adaptations in gait and muscle activation patterns during
               split-belt walking in healthy young and middle-aged adults.
               Young (23.3 $\pm$ 3.13 years) and middle-aged adults (55.3 $\pm$
               2.91 years) walked on an instrumented split-belt treadmill. Both
               age groups adapted similarly by reducing asymmetry in step
               length and double support time. Surface EMG was recorded from
               eight leg muscles bilaterally. Principal Component Analysis
               (PCA) was applied to the EMG data of all subjects, for the fast
               and slow leg separately, to identify muscle activation patterns.
               The principal components consisted of i.e. temporal projections
               that were analyzed with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM).
               The functional muscle groups, identified by PCA, increased
               activation during early adaptation and post-adaptation, and
               decreased activation over time similarly in both age groups.
               Extra activation peaks of the plantar- and dorsiflexors suggest
               a role in gait modulation during split-belt walking. Both young
               and middle-aged adults re-established gait symmetry and showed
               adaptation effects in the muscle activation patterns. Since the
               adaptation of muscle activation patterns parallels adaptation of
               gait symmetry, changes in muscle activation likely underlie the
               changes in step parameters during split-belt adaptation. In
               conclusion, split-belt adaptation, in terms of gait and muscle
               activation patterns, is still preserved at middle-age,
               suggesting that age-related differences occur later in the
               lifespan.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Muscle co-activation plays an important role in
              enhancing joint stability for movement regulation during motor
              learning activities. In normal aging, greater muscle
              co-activation is induced during gait in elderly adults. This
              study investigated age-related changes in muscle co-activation
              and spatio-temporal parameters during gait and identified the
              relationship between muscle co-activation and gait speed.
              METHODS: A total of 46 adult volunteers participated in this
              study in three age groups (15 young adults [8 males, 7 females;
              age, 24.27 $\pm$ 2.71], 15 middle-aged adults [8 males, 7
              females; age, 53.71 $\pm$ 2.52], and 16 elderly adults [7 males,
              9 females; age, 76.88 $\pm$ 3.48]). All participants underwent
              locomotion analysis using a Three-dimensional motion analysis
              system and 12-channel dynamic electromyography. RESULTS: The
              elderly adults showed significantly higher co-activation than the
              young and middle-aged adults during gait (p < 0.05). In contrast,
              elderly adults showed significantly lower trunk co-activation
              than the young and middle-aged adults (p < 0.05). Muscle
              co-activation was significantly correlated with gait speed by
              aging. Muscle co-activation of the trunk showed a significant
              positive correlation with gait speed based on age. However,
              muscle co-activation of the lower extremity showed a significant
              negative correlation with gait speed based on age. CONCLUSION:
              This finding demonstrated that less muscle co-activation of the
              trunk was related to locomotive instability in elderly adults.
              Therefore, clarification of the relationship between trunk
              co-activation and locomotor instability will be helpful for
              developing optimal rehabilitation of elderly people to prevent

              The latter performed six weeks of balance training for the right
              leg. The pre- and post-training measurements were based on single
              leg standing posture on a moveable force platform which moved 6

              (SLR), medium- (MLR), and long-latency response of shank and
              thigh muscles as well as ankle, knee, and hip joint kinematics
              (amplitudes and velocities) were recorded. Both training
              modalities revealed reduced angular velocity in the ankle joint
              (P < 0.05) accompanied by increased shank muscle activity in SLR
              (P < 0.05) during marching in place perturbation. During stance
              perturbation and marching in place perturbation, hip angular
              velocity was decreased after RBT (P from TTEST, Pt < 0.05)
              accompanied by enhanced thigh muscle activity (SLR, MLR) after
              both trainings (P < 0.05). Effect sizes were larger for the
              RBT-group during stance perturbation. Thus, both interventions
              revealed modified stabilization strategies for reactive balance
              recovery after surface translations. Characterized by enhanced
              reflex activity in the leg muscles antagonizing the surface
              translations, balance training is associated with improved
              neuromuscular timing and accuracy being relevant for postural
              control. This may result in more efficient segmental
              stabilization during fall risk situations, independent of the
              intervention modality. More pronounced modulations and higher
              effect sizes after RBT in stance perturbation point toward
              specificity of training adaptations, with an emphasis on the
              proximal body segment for RBT. Outcomes underline the benefits of
              balance training with a clear distinction between RBT and CBT
              being relevant for training application over the lifespan.",

  abstract = "Evidence-based prescriptions for balance training in youth have

              standardized means available to assess and quantify balance task
              difficulty (BTD). Therefore, the objectives of this study were to
              examine the effects of graded BTD on postural sway, lower limb
              muscle activity and coactivation in adolescents. Thirteen healthy
              high-school students aged 16 to 17 volunteered to participate in
              this cross-sectional study. Testing involved participants to
              stand on a commercially available balance board with an
              adjustable pivot that allowed six levels of increasing task
              difficulty. Postural sway [i.e., total center of pressure (CoP)
              displacements] and lower limb muscle activity were recorded
              simultaneously during each trial. Surface electromyography (EMG)
              was applied in muscles encompassing the ankle (m. tibialis
              anterior, medial gastrocnemius, peroneus longus) and knee joint
              (m. vastus medialis, biceps femoris). The coactivation index
              (CAI) was calculated for ankle and thigh muscles. Repeated
              measures analyses of variance revealed a significant main effect
              of BTD with increasing task difficulty for postural sway (p <
              0.001; d = 6.36), muscle activity (p < 0.001; 2.19 < d < 4.88),
              and CAI (p < 0.001; 1.32 < d < 1.41). Multiple regression
              analyses showed that m. tibialis anterior activity best explained
              overall CoP displacements with 32.5\% explained variance (p <
              0.001). The observed increases in postural sway, lower limb
              muscle activity, and coactivation indicate increasing postural
              demands while standing on the balance board. Thus, the examined
              board can be implemented in balance training to progressively
              increase BTD in healthy adolescents.",

              revisited",
  author   = "Duchateau, Jacques and Baudry, St{\'e}phane",
  abstract = "In addition to the role of muscle coactivation, a major question
              in the field is how antagonist activation is controlled to
              minimize its opposing effect on agonist muscle performance.
              Muscle fatigue is an interesting condition to analyze the neural
              adjustments in antagonist muscle activity and to gain more
              insights into the control mechanisms of coactivation. In that
              context, previous studies have reported that although the EMG
              activity of agonists and antagonists increase in parallel, the
              ratio between EMG activities in the two sets of muscles during a
              fatiguing submaximal contraction decreased progressively and
              contributed to a reduction in the time to task failure. In
              contrast, more recent studies using a novel normalization
              procedure indicated that the agonist/antagonist ratio remained
              relatively constant, suggesting that the fatigue-related increase
              in coactivation does not impede performance. Current knowledge
              also indicates that peripheral mechanisms cannot by themselves
              mediate the intensity of antagonist coactivation during fatiguing
              contractions, implying that supraspinal mechanisms are involved.
              The unique modulation of the synaptic input from Ia afferents to
              the antagonist motor neurones during a fatiguing contraction of
              the agonist muscles further suggests a separate control of the

              contribute to standing balance, but the potential impacts of
              threats to standing balance on Ib reflexes are unknown. Tendon
              electrical stimulation to the Achilles' tendon was used to probe
              changes in Ib inhibition in medial gastrocnemius with postural
              orientation (lying prone vs. upright standing; experiment 1) and
              height-induced postural threat (standing at low and high surface
              heights; experiment 2). Ib inhibition was reduced while
              participants stood upright, compared to lying prone (42.2\%); and
              further reduced when standing in the high, compared to low,
              threat condition (32.4\%). These experiments will impact future
              research because they demonstrate that tendon electrical
              stimulation can be used to probe Ib reflexes in muscles engaged

              as evidenced by changes with postural orientation, and context,
              such as height-induced postural threat during standing. ABSTRACT:
              Golgi tendon organ Ib reflexes are thought to contribute to
              standing balance control, but it is unknown if they are modulated
              when people are exposed to a postural threat. We used a novel
              application of tendon electrical stimulation (TStim) to elicit Ib
              inhibitory reflexes in the medial gastrocnemius, while actively
              engaged in upright standing balance, to examine (a) how Ib
              reflexes to TStim are influenced by upright stance, and (b) the
              effects of height-induced postural threat on Ib reflexes during
              standing. TStim evoked short-latency (<47 ms) inhibition apparent
              in trigger-averaged rectified EMG, which was quantified in terms
              of area, duration and mean amplitude of inhibition. In order to
              validate the use of TStim in a standing model, TStim-Ib
              inhibition was compared from conditions where participants were
              lying prone vs. standing upright. TStim evoked Ib inhibition in
              both conditions; however, significant reductions in Ib inhibition
              area (42.2\%) and duration (32.9\%) were observed during stance.
              Postural threat, manipulated by having participants stand at LOW
              (0.8 m high, 0.6 m from edge) and HIGH (3.2 m, at edge) elevated
              surfaces, significantly reduced Ib inhibition area (32.4\%),
              duration (16.4\%) and amplitude (24.8\%) in the HIGH, compared to
              LOW, threat condition. These results demonstrate TStim is a
              viable technique for investigating Ib reflexes in standing, and
              confirm Ib reflexes are modulated with postural orientation. The
              novel observation of reduced Ib inhibition with elevated postural
              threat reveals that human Ib reflexes are context dependent, and
              the human Ib reflex pathways are modulated by threat or emotional
              processing centres of the CNS.",

               to improve balance with a simple intervention.Methods: Eighteen
               healthy able-bodied subjects (4 males) were included in the
               study. Self-massage, Kinesio? tape and a custom-made insole were

              task. Subjects (N=9) received soleus (S) H-reflexes in blocks of
              seven trials while free standing on a normal base-of-support
              (NBOS) and while standing on a plafform with a reduced
              base-of-support (RBOS) in the sagittal plane. During the RBOS
              condition, the H-reflex served as a postural perturbation.
              Subjects were instructed to suppress the H-reflex when it was
              evoked, as an attempt to maintain a balanced state. Background
              EMG from the S and tibialis anterior muscles, the S M-wave, and
              stimulus current were maintained at a constant level during the
              experiment. Subjects initially received a block of NBOS trials,
              followed by 4 RBOS blocks (training), a second NBOS block, four
              additional RBOS blocks, and a third NBOS block with the protocol
              repeated on three different days (D1, D2 and D3) within the same
              week. The S H/M ratio was depressed 9\% upon standing on the
              RBOS. With training the S H/M ratio decreased by 22\% on Dl, 18\%
              on D2 and 6\% on D3. The ratio between the H-reflex and
              background S EMG (H-reflex gain) decreased 10\% on D1, 40\% on D2
              and 23\% on D3 when the first NBOS and first RBOS blocks were
              compared. Due to a slight increase in the S EMG across blocks,
              the H-reflex gain decreased considerably more across blocks than
              the H/M ratio. Although the S H/M ratio underwent an 7\% decrease
              from D1 to D3, the differences were not significant.
              Individually, however, six of the nine subjects decreased their

  abstract  = "External perturbation forces may compromise standing balance.
               The nervous system can intervene only after a delay greater than
               100 ms, during which the body falls freely. With ageing,
               sensorimotor delays are prolonged, posing a critical threat to
               balance. We study a generic model of stabilisation with neural
               delays to understand how the organism should adapt to
               challenging balance conditions. The model suggests that ankle
               stiffness should be increased in anticipation of perturbations,
               for example by muscle co-contraction, so as to slow down body
               fall during the neural response delay. Increased ankle muscle
               co-contraction is indeed observed in young adults when standing
               in challenging balance conditions, and in older relative to
               young adults during normal stance. In parallel, the analysis of
               the model shows that increases in either stiffness or neural
               delay must be coordinated with decreases in spinal sensorimotor
               gains, otherwise the feedback itself becomes destabilizing.
               Accordingly, a decrease in spinal feedback is observed in
               challenging conditions, and with age-related increases in neural
               delay. These observations have been previously interpreted as
               indicating an increased reliance on cortical rather than spinal
               control of balance, despite the fact that cortical responses
               have a longer latency. Our analysis challenges this
               interpretation by showing that these observations are consistent
               with a functional coadaptation of spinal feedback gains to
               functional changes in stiffness and neural delay.",

              the ankle, knee and hip joints, decreased with fatigue (P <

              increased and spinal excitability in SOL declined. (3)
              Adaptations progressively augmented with progressing exhaustion

              deteriorated balance ability was accompanied by a modified
              neuromuscular control---the increase in co-contraction reflected
              by simultaneously activated antagonists is accompanied by smaller
              knee and hip joint excursions, indicating an elevated level of
              articular stiffness. These changes may be associated with an
              exaggerated postural rigidity and could have caused the delayed
              and reduced postural reactions that are reflected in the changes
              in COP displacement when compensating for sudden PERT. The

               incorporates motor commands into a previously established model
               of optimal passive self-motion estimation. The simulated sensory
               error and feedback signals match experimentally measured
               neuronal responses during active and passive head and trunk
               rotations and translations. We conclude that a single sensory
               internal model can combine motor commands with vestibular and
               proprioceptive signals optimally. Thus, although neurons
               carrying sensory prediction error or feedback signals show
               attenuated modulation, the sensory cues and internal model are
               both engaged and critically important for accurate self-motion
               estimation during active head movements.",

               balanced moves at a rate that is beyond the abilities of human
               motor control. This illustrates that responsiveness of motor
               control is limited and can be investigated by changing the
               dynamics of the task. In this study, the responsiveness of trunk
               motor control was investigated by changing the seat stiffness of
               an unstable seat. At decreasing levels of seat stiffness the
               probability of successfully balancing on the seat, speed of the
               seat, speed of the trunk relative to the seat (trunk-seat) and
               muscle activation of five trunk muscles were assessed. Also,
               across the different stiffness levels, the relation between
               trunk muscle activation and seat speed was determined. As
               hypothesized, with decreasing seat stiffness the probability of
               success decreased, seat speed and trunk-seat speed increased,
               and both agonist and antagonist activation increased. This shows
               that limits in the responsiveness of trunk motor control were
               reached during seated balancing. Furthermore, in line with our
               hypothesis, a positive relation was found between trunk muscle
               activation and seat speed. It appears that the central nervous
               system regulates trunk stiffness (via muscle coactivation) in
               relation to the dynamics of the task, possibly to maintain

              rhythmic gymnasts (8 and 21 years old) performed balances on
              tiptoes (side split with hand support, ring with hand support)

              Ankle joint stabilizing activity of GM and GL muscles in the

              design is motivated by the nonlinear viscoelasticity of the
              tissue, which increases with the normal surface pressure. This,
              in theory, results in higher conductivity of mechanical waves and

              During normal walking, muscle co-contraction increases with gait
              speed in young adults, but not in elderly adults. However, no
              study has compared the effects of speed on muscle co-contraction
              of the ankle joint during dynamic postural control in young and

              joint between young and elderly subjects during a functional
              stability boundary test at different speeds. METHODS: Fifteen
              young adults and 16 community-dwelling elderly adults
              participated in this study. The task was functional stability
              boundary tests at different speeds (preferred and fast).
              Electromyographic evaluations of the tibialis anterior and soleus
              were recorded. The muscle co-contraction was evaluated using the
              co-contraction index (CI). RESULTS: There were no statistically
              significant differences in the postural sway parameters between
              the two age groups. Elderly subjects showed larger CI in both
              speed conditions than did the young subjects. CI was higher in
              the fast speed condition than in the preferred speed condition in
              the young subjects, but there was no difference in the elderly
              subjects. Moreover, after dividing the analytical range into

              in the deceleration phase than in the acceleration phase in both
              groups, except for the young subjects in the fast speed

              in elderly subjects than in young subjects not only in the
              preferred speed condition but also in the fast speed condition.
              In addition, the young subjects showed increased muscle

              investigated the feasibility of using two common CCIs to
              approximate lower limb joint stiffness trends during gait.
              Calibrated EMG-driven lower extremity musculoskeletal models
              constructed for two individuals post-stroke were used to generate
              the quantities required for CCI calculations and model-based
              estimation of joint stiffness. CCIs were calculated for various
              combinations of antagonist muscle pairs based on two common CCI
              formulations: Rudolph et al. (2000) (CCI1) and Falconer and
              Winter (1985) (CCI2). CCI1 measures antagonist muscle activation
              relative to not only total activation of agonist plus antagonist
              muscles but also agonist muscle activation, while CCI2 measures
              antagonist muscle activation relative to only total muscle
              activation. We computed the correlation between these two CCIs
              and model-based estimates of sagittal plane joint stiffness for
              the hip, knee, and ankle of both legs. Although we observed
              moderate to strong correlations between some CCI formulations and
              corresponding joint stiffness, these associations were highly
              dependent on the methodological choices made for CCI computation.
              Specifically, we found that: (1) CCI1 was generally more
              correlated with joint stiffness than was CCI2, (2) CCI
              calculation using EMG signals with calibrated electromechanical
              delay generally yielded the best correlations with joint
              stiffness, and (3) choice of antagonist muscle pairs
              significantly influenced CCI correlation with joint stiffness. By
              providing guidance on how methodological choices influence CCI
              correlation with joint stiffness trends, this study may
              facilitate a simpler alternate approach for studying joint
              stiffness during human movement.",

  abstract = "Antagonistic muscle activity can impair performance, increase
              metabolic cost, and increase joint stability. Excessive
              antagonist muscle activity may also cause an undesirable increase
              in joint contact forces in certain populations such as persons
              with knee osteoarthritis. Co-contraction of antagonistic muscles
              measured by electromyography (EMG) is a popular method used to
              infer muscle forces and subsequent joint forces. However, EMG
              alone cannot completely describe joint loads that are
              experienced. This study compares a co-contraction index from EMG
              to a co-contraction index calculated from simulated muscle
              moments during gait. Co-contraction indices were calculated from
              nine healthy, able-bodied subjects during treadmill walking at
              self-selected speed. Musculoskeletal simulations that tracked
              experimental kinematics and kinetics were generated for each
              subject. Experimentally measured EMG was used to constrain the
              model's muscle excitation for the vastus lateralis and
              semimembranosus muscles. Using the model's excitations as
              constrained by EMG, muscle activation and muscle moments were
              calculated. A common co-contraction index (CCI) based on EMG was
              compared with co-contraction based on normalized modeled muscle
              moments (MCCI). While the overall patterns were similar, the
              co-contraction predicted by MCCI was significantly lower than
              CCI. Because a simulation can account for passive muscle forces
              not detected with traditional EMG analysis, MCCI may better
              reflect physiological knee joint loads. Overall, the application
              of two co-contraction methods provides a more complete
              description of muscle co-contraction and joint loading than
              either method individually.",

              has traditionally been ascribed to memory impairments and
              dysexecutive function, whereas the impact of visual aging has
              often been overlooked. The ability to perceive visuospatial
              information such as salient landmarks is essential to navigating

              underpinning landmark processing in aging remain insufficiently
              characterized. To address this issue, functional magnetic
              resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to investigate the brain
              activity associated with landmark-based navigation in young and
              healthy older participants. The performances of 25 young adults
              ($\mu$ = 25.4 years, $\sigma$ = 2.7; seven females) and 17 older
              adults ($\mu$ = 73.0 years, $\sigma$ = 3.9; 10 females) were
              assessed in a virtual-navigation task in which they had to orient
              using salient landmarks. The underlying whole-brain patterns of
              activity as well as the functional roles of specific cerebral
              regions involved in landmark processing, namely the
              parahippocampal place area (PPA), the occipital place area (OPA),
              and the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), were analyzed. Older adults'
              navigational abilities were overall diminished compared to young
              adults. Also, the two age groups relied on distinct navigational
              strategies to solve the task. Better performances during
              landmark-based navigation were associated with increased neural
              activity in an extended neural network comprising several
              cortical and cerebellar regions. Direct comparisons between age
              groups revealed that young participants had greater anterior
              temporal activity. Also, only young adults showed significant
              activity in occipital areas corresponding to the cortical
              projection of the central visual field during landmark-based
              navigation. The region-of-interest analysis revealed an increased
              OPA activation in older adult participants during the landmark
              condition. There were no significant between-group differences in
              PPA and RSC activations. These preliminary results hint at the
              possibility that aging diminishes fine-grained information
              processing in occipital and temporal regions, thus hindering the
              capacity to use landmarks adequately for navigation. Keeping
              sight of its exploratory nature, this work helps towards a better
              comprehension of the neural dynamics subtending landmark-based
              navigation and it provides new insights on the impact of

               healthy people is considered a normal strategy that aids
               movement efficiency during the performance of functional
               activities. In some cases, however, it is an abnormal strategy
               that aids stability and/or precision but not efficiency of
               movement. Co-activation varies not only between agonist and
               antagonist pairs, but within a pair from time to time, and
               depending on a range of factors. Muscle co-activation strategies
               are used when uncertainty in relation to execution of a specific
               task occurs, during the learning of a new skill or as
               compensation. Movement dysfunction in neurological conditions
               may coincide with abnormal levels of co-activation. It is
               unclear at what level co-activation assists or impedes
               functional ability, and to what extent reduced agonist
               excitation and antagonist co-activation combine to cause
               significant weakness. A major limitation in understanding the
               mechanisms of co-activation in neurologically impaired
               individuals is the wide range of methods that are used to
               determine levels of antagonist activation and hence

               occur alongside clinical features in neurological conditions, it
               is often viewed as a task-related strategy used to cope with the
               complexity of a task. This review highlights whether the use of

               while standing with no additional muscle coactivation, low

               estimated using indices of postural sway and of intertrial
               variance in the space of muscle groups with parallel scaling of
               activation levels (M-modes). An increase in coactivation led to

  abstract  = "The ability to maintain stable, upright standing in the face of
               perturbations is a critical component of daily life. A common
               strategy for resisting perturbations and maintaining stability
               is muscle coactivation. Although arm muscle coactivation is
               often used during adaptation of seated reaching movements,
               little is known about postural muscle activation during
               concurrent adaptation of arm and standing posture to novel
               perturbations. In this study we investigate whether coactivation
               strategies are employed during adaptation of standing postural
               control, and how these strategies are prioritized for adaptation
               of standing posture and arm reaching, in two different postural
               stability conditions. Healthy adults practiced planar reaching
               movements while grasping the handle of a robotic arm and
               standing on a force plate; the robotic arm generated a
               velocity-dependent force field that created novel perturbations
               in the forward (more stable) or backward (less stable)
               direction. Surprisingly, the degree of arm and postural
               adaptation was not influenced by stability, with similar
               adaptation observed between conditions in the control of both
               arm movement and standing posture. We found that an early
               coactivation strategy can be used in postural adaptation,
               similar to what is observed in adaptation of arm reaching
               movements. However, the emergence of a coactivation strategy was
               dependent on perturbation direction. Despite similar adaptation
               in both directions, postural coactivation was largely specific
               to forward perturbations. Backward perturbations led to less
               coactivation and less modulation of postural muscle activity.
               These findings provide insight into how postural stability can
               affect prioritization of postural control objectives and
               movement adaptation strategies.NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Muscle
               coactivation is a key strategy for modulating movement
               stability; this is centrally important in the control of
               standing posture. Our study investigates the little-known role
               of coactivation in adaptation of whole body standing postural
               control. We demonstrate that an early coactivation strategy can
               be used in postural adaptation, but muscle activation strategies
               may differ depending on postural stability conditions.",

               generalization: errors in one movement influence prediction in
               other types of movement. If the mapping is accomplished with
               population coding, combining basis elements that encode
               different regions of movement space, then generalization can
               reveal the encoding of the basis elements. We present a theory
               that relates encoding to generalization using trial-by-trial
               changes in behavior during adaptation. We consider adaptation
               during reaching movements in various velocity-dependent force
               fields and quantify how errors generalize across direction. We
               find that the measurement of error is critical to the theory. A
               typical assumption in motor control is that error is the
               difference between a current trajectory and a desired trajectory
               (DJ) that does not change during adaptation. Under this
               assumption, in all force fields that we examined, including one
               in which force randomly changes from trial to trial, we found a
               bimodal generalization pattern, perhaps reflecting basis
               elements that encode direction bimodally. If the DJ was allowed
               to vary, bimodality was reduced or eliminated, but the
               generalization function accounted for nearly twice as much
               variance. We suggest, therefore, that basis elements
               representing the internal model of dynamics are sensitive to
               limb velocity with bimodal tuning; however, it is also possible
               that during adaptation the error metric itself adapts, which

              velocity-dependent force field (VF), which resulted in perturbed
              but stable hand trajectories, or a position-dependent divergent
              force field (DF), which resulted in unstable trajectories. With
              practice, subjects learned to compensate for the perturbations
              produced by both force fields. Adaptation was characterized by an
              initial increase in the activation of all muscles followed by a
              gradual reduction. The time course of the increase in activation
              was correlated with a reduction in hand-path error for the DF but
              not for the VF. Adaptation to the VF could have been achieved

              dynamics learning in tasks that are thought to involve finely
              sculpted feedforward adjustments to motor commands. We find that,
              even following substantial training, cocontraction varies in a
              systematic way that depends on both movement direction and the
              strength of the external load. The proportion of total activity
              that is due to cocontraction nevertheless remains remarkably
              constant. Moreover, long after indices of motor learning and
              electromyographic measures have reached asymptotic levels,
              cocontraction still accounts for a significant proportion of
              total muscle activity in all phases of movement and in all load
              conditions. These results show that even following dynamics
              learning in predictable and stable environments, cocontraction
              forms a central part of the means by which the nervous system
              regulates movement.",

  abstract  = "Since Sherrington's convincing demonstration of the reciprocal
               innervation of opposing muscles, it has generally been thought
               that antagonist muscles are inactive during most voluntary
               movements. However, more recent evidence suggests that
               excitation of Renshaw cells may facilitate antagonist
               coactivation whereas excitation of Ia inhibitory neurons can
               induce reciprocal inhibition. A body of evidence has accumulated
               to indicate some of the circumstances which particularly favour
               the co-contraction of antagonist muscles. Isometric prehension,
               either in the precision grip or the power grip, can be shown to
               be one of the most important examples of antagonist
               coactivation. Studies of the discharge of single Purkinje cells
               of the intermediate cerebellar cortex in awake monkeys during
               performance of a maintained grip revealed that the majority of
               these neurons are deactivated during antagonist co-contraction.
               In contrast, other, unidentified neurons of the cerebellar
               cortex were as a group activated during grasping. It is
               suggested that the Purkinje cells act to inhibit antagonist
               muscles during reciprocal inhibition but are themselves
               inhibited during antagonist coactivation. These results support
               a suggestion made by Tilney and Pike in 1925 that the cerebellum
               plays an important role in switching between the coactivation
               and reciprocal inhibition of antagonist muscles.",

               understand the contribution of psychological factors such as
               fear of falling. In this study we examined kinetic and kinematic
               parameters during quiet stance of eight young healthy adults
               standing under three conditions which posed increasing levels of
               postural threat. Participants were required to stand quietly,
               both with and without visual information and with normal or
               reduced vestibular information for 2-min periods at each of
               three surface conditions: ground level (low threat), 81 cm above
               the ground completely surrounded by a support surface (medium
               threat) and 81 cm above ground at the edge of the surface (high
               threat). In addition to calculating displacement and frequency
               measures for movements of centre of pressure (COP) and centre of
               mass (COM), a measure of stiffness was derived from the
               difference between COP-COM signal. Mean EMG activity was
               recorded bilaterally from anterior and posterior muscles of the
               lower and upper leg. A stiffening strategy was adopted when
               individuals stood under high threat conditions involving
               significant changes in kinematic, kinetic and EMG variables. The
               A-P stiffness constant increased significantly (27.5\%) for the
               high threat compared to low threat condition, independent of

               accompanied by: (1) backward shift of the mean A-P position of
               COP and COM, (2) increased mean power frequency and decreased
               amplitude displacement of the COP and (3) decreased amplitude
               displacements of the COM. Of the significant changes observed in
               mean EMG activity with increased postural threat, only tibialis
               anterior was significantly correlated with increased stiffness,
               while activity in soleus, medial gastrocnemius and rectus

              acquired skills to real-life tasks and conditions. How older
              adults adapt gait control to different conditions, and whether
              these adaptations are altered by balance training remains
              unclear. We investigated adaptations in neuromuscular control of
              gait in twenty-two older adults (72.6 $\pm$ 4.2 years) between
              normal (NW) and narrow-base walking (NBW), and the effects of a
              standing balance training program shown to enhance unipedal
              balance control in the same participants. At baseline, after one
              session and after 3-weeks of training, kinematics and EMG of NW
              and NBW on a treadmill were measured. Gait parameters and
              temporal activation profiles of five synergies extracted from 11
              muscles were compared between time-points and gait conditions. No
              effects of balance training or interactions between training and
              walking condition on gait parameters or synergies were found.
              Trunk center of mass (CoM) displacement and velocity (vCoM), and
              the local divergence exponent (LDE), were lower in NBW compared
              to NW. For synergies associated with stance of the non-dominant
              leg and weight acceptance of the dominant leg, full width at half
              maximum (FWHM) of the activation profiles was smaller in NBW
              compared to NW. For the synergy associated with non-dominant heel
              strike, FWHM was greater in NBW compared to NW. The Center of
              Activation (CoA) of the activation profile associated with
              dominant leg stance occurred earlier in NBW compared to NW. CoAs
              of activation profile associated with non-dominant stance and
              non-dominant and dominant heel strikes were delayed in NBW
              compared to NW. The adaptations of synergies to NBW can be
              interpreted as related to a more cautious weight transfer to the
              new stance leg and enhanced control over CoM movement in the
              stance phase. However, control of mediolateral gait stability and
              these adaptations were not affected by balance training.",

               right leg and trunk muscles in 17 young (11 males and 6 females;
               age 24 $\pm$ 3 years) and 14 older adults (3 males and 11
               females; age 69 $\pm$ 4 years) while walking on a taped line on
               the floor and a 6-cm wide beam. Spatiotemporal parameters of
               gait, margin of stability, motor performance, and muscle
               synergies were estimated. Regardless of age, maintaining walking
               balance was more difficult on the beam compared to the taped
               line as evidenced by a shorter distance walked (17.3\%), a
               reduction in step length (5.8\%) and speed (10.3\%), as well as
               a 40.0\% smaller margin of stability during beam vs. tape
               walking. The number of muscle synergies was also higher during
               beam vs. tape walking. Compared to younger adults, older adults
               had larger margin of stability during beam walking. Older adults
               also had higher muscle co-activity within each muscle synergy

               a safer, less efficient, and less complex neuromuscular modular
               control strategy. In conclusion, beam walking increased the
               difficulty of maintaining walking balance and induced
               adaptations in modular control. It seems that healthy older
               adults reduce the complexity and efficiency of neuromuscular
               control of walking to preserve walking balance.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Slips account for a high percentage of falls and
               subsequent injuries in community-dwelling older adults but not
               in young adults. This phenomenon suggests that although active
               and healthy older adults preserve a mobility level comparable to
               that of young adults, these older adults may have difficulty
               generating efficient reactive postural responses when they slip.
               This study tested the hypothesis that active and healthy older
               adults use a less effective reactive balance strategy than young
               adults when experiencing an unexpected forward slip occurring at
               heel strike during walking. This less effective balance strategy
               would be manifested by slower and smaller postural responses,
               altered temporal and spatial organization of the postural
               responses, and greater upper trunk instability after the slip.
               METHODS: Thirty-three young adults (age range=19-34 yrs,
               mean=25+/-4 yrs) and 32 community-dwelling older adults (age
               range=70-87 yrs, mean=74+/-14 yrs) participated. Subjects walked
               across a movable forceplate which simulated a forward slip at
               heel strike. Surface electromyography was recorded from
               bilateral leg, thigh, hip, and trunk muscles. Kinematic data
               were collected from the right (perturbed) side of the body.
               RESULTS: Although the predominant postural muscles and the
               activation sequence of these muscles were similar between the
               two age groups, the postural responses of older adults were of
               longer onset latencies, smaller magnitudes, and longer burst
               durations compared to young adults. Older adults also showed a
               longer coactivation duration for the ankle, knee, and trunk
               agonist/antagonist pairs on the perturbed side and for the knee
               agonist/antagonist pair on the nonperturbed side. Behaviorally,
               older adults became less stable after the slips. This was
               manifested by a higher incidence of being tripped (21 trials in
               older vs 5 trials in young adults) and a greater trunk
               hyperextension with respect to young adults. Large arm elevation
               was frequently used by older adults to assist in maintaining
               trunk stability. In an attempt to quickly reestablish the base
               of support after the slips, older adults had an earlier
               contralateral foot strike and shortened stride length.
               CONCLUSION: The combination of slower onset and smaller
               magnitude of postural responses to slips in older adults
               resulted in an inefficient balance strategy. Older adults needed
               secondary compensatory adjustments, including a lengthened
               response duration and the use of the arms, to fully regain
               balance and prevent a fall. The shorter stride length and
               earlier contralateral foot strike following the slip indicate
               use of a more conservative balance strategy in older adults.",

               tibialis anterior, vastus lateralis, and rectus femoris as
               healthy young and older adults walked over ground at slow,
               preferred and fast walking speeds. Nineteen healthy older adults

               mean activities over a gait cycle at the preferred speed,
               allowing for an assessment of how the activity was distributed
               over the gait cycle and modulated with speed. Compared to the
               young adults, the older adults exhibited greater activation of
               the tibialis anterior and soleus during mid-stance at all
               walking speeds and greater activation of the vastus lateralis
               and medial hamstrings during loading and mid-stance at the fast
               walking speed, suggesting increased coactivation across the
               ankle and knee. In addition, older adults depend less on soleus
               muscle activation to push off at faster walking speeds. We

               age on leg muscle activity amplitudes and timing during level,
               uphill, and downhill walking. We hypothesized that old adults
               would exhibit smaller increases in ankle extensor muscle

               antagonist leg muscle coactivation would be disproportionately
               greater in old vs. young adults during downhill walking. Ten old
               (72$\pm$5yrs) and ten young (25$\pm$4yrs) subjects walked at
               1.25m/s on a treadmill at seven grades (0°, $\pm$3°, $\pm$6°,
               $\pm$9°). We quantified the stance phase electromyographic
               activities of the gluteus maximus (GMAX), biceps femoris (BF),
               rectus femoris (RF), vastus medialis (VM), medial gastrocnemius
               (MG), soleus (SOL), and tibialis anterior (TA). Old adults
               exhibited smaller increases in MG activity with steeper uphill
               grade than young adults (e.g., +136\% vs. +174\% at 9°). A
               disproportionate recruitment of hip muscles led to GMAX activity
               approaching the maximum isometric capacity of these active old
               adults at steep uphill grades (e.g., old vs. young, 73\% MVC vs.
               33\% MVC at +9°). Neither uphill nor downhill walking affected
               the greater coactivation of antagonist muscles in old vs. young
               adults. We conclude that the disproportionate recruitment of hip
               muscles with advanced age may have critical implications for
               maintaining independent mobility in old adults, particularly at
               steeper uphill grades.",

               offer clinicians insight into both underlying neural strategies
               for movement and functional outcomes of muscle activity.
               Although neural dysfunction is central to many motor deficits,
               neural activity during movements is not directly measurable.
               Consequently, the majority of clinical tests focus on evaluating
               motor outputs at the behavioral and kinematic levels. However,
               altered behavioral or kinematic outcomes could be the result of
               multiple distinct neural abnormalities with very different
               muscle coordination patterns. Because muscle activity reflects
               motoneuron activity and generates the forces that produce
               behavioral outcomes, an analysis of muscle activity may provide
               a better understanding of the functional neural deficits in the
               impaired nervous system. Unfortunately electromyographic
               datasets can be large, highly variable, and difficult to
               interpret, precluding their clinical utility. Computational
               analyses can be used to extract muscle synergies from such
               datasets, revealing underlying patterns that may reflect
               different levels of neural function. These muscle synergies are
               hypothesized to represent motor modules recruited by the nervous
               system to flexibly perform biomechanical subtasks necessary for
               movement. For example, hemiparetic stroke patients exhibit
               differences in the number of muscle synergies, which may reflect
               disruptions in descending neural pathways and are correlated to
               deficits in motor function. Muscle synergy analysis may thus
               offer the clinician a better view of the neural structure
               underlying motor behaviors and how they change in motor deficits
               and rehabilitation. Such information could inform diagnostic

               low-dimensional joint coactivation spaces. Through analyzing
               human motion, we first show that the dimensionality of many
               motion tasks is much smaller than the full degrees of freedom
               (DOFs) of the character. Indeed, joint motion appears organized
               across DOFs, with multiple joints moving together and working in
               synchrony. We exploit such redundancy for character control by
               extracting task-specific joint coactivations from human recorded
               motion, capturing synchronized patterns of simultaneous joint
               movements that effectively reduce the control space across DOFs.
               By learning how to excite such coactivations using deep
               reinforcement learning, we are able to train humanlike
               controllers using only a small number of dimensions. We
               demonstrate our approach on a range of motor tasks and show its

               minimalistic rewards that simply follow the center-of-mass of a

               reference characters. In all cases, by learning a 10-dimensional

               high-fidelity locomotion even in the presence of sparse reward

              performance under increasing task demands depends on the
              regulation and coordination of neural resources. Studies have
              shown that such resources diminish with aging and disease. EEG
              spectral analysis is a method that has the potential to provide
              insight into neural alterations affecting motor-cognitive
              performance. The aim of this study was to assess changes in
              spectral analysis during dual-task walking in aging and disease
              METHODS: 10 young adults, ten older adults, and ten patients with
              Parkinson's disease (PD) completed an auditory oddball task while
              standing and while walking on a treadmill. Spectral power within
              four frequency bandwidths, delta (< 4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha
              (8-12 Hz), and beta (12-30 Hz), was calculated using
              Event-Related Spectral Perturbation (ERSP) analyses and compared
              between single task and dual task and between groups. RESULTS:
              Differences in ERSP were found in all groups between the single
              and dual-task conditions. In response to dual-task walking, beta
              increased in all groups (p < 0.026), delta decreased in young
              adults (p = 0.03) and patients with PD (0.015) while theta
              increased in young adults (p = 0.028) but decreased in older
              adults (p = 0.02) and patients with PD (p = 0.015). Differences
              were seen between the young, the older adults, and the patients
              with PD. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are the first to show
              changes in the power of different frequency bands during
              dual-task walking with aging and disease. These specific brain
              modulations may reflect deficits in readiness and allocation of

              assessed using an active contralateral matching task. Despite
              successfully inducing similar levels of sway in the two age
              groups, older adults still showed higher muscle co-contraction. A
              stepwise regression analysis showed that proprioceptive acuity

              previous research, proprioceptive error and muscle co-contraction
              were negatively correlated in older adults, suggesting that
              better proprioceptive acuity predicts more co-contraction.
              Overall, these results suggest that although muscle
              co-contraction may be an age-specific strategy used by older
              adults, it is not to compensate for age-related proprioceptive

              of the neural control of locomotion. Their seminal work supported
              subsequently by several decades of evidence has led to the
              conclusion that walking, flying, and swimming are largely
              controlled by a network of spinal neurons generally referred to
              as the central pattern generator (CPG) for locomotion. It has
              been subsequently demonstrated across all vertebrate species
              examined, from lampreys to humans, that this CPG is capable,
              under some conditions, to self-produce, even in absence of

              It has been the object of motor control and neuroscience research
              for over a century, but studies often constrain movement to
              eliminate the effect of gravity or reduce the degrees of freedom.
              In some studies, aging has been shown to reduce target accuracy,
              with a mechanism suggested to be impaired corrective movements.
              We sought first to explore the changes in control of shoulder and
              elbow joint movements that occur with aging during performance of
              reaching movements to different target heights with the normal
              effects of gravity, unconstrained hand movement, and stable
              target locations. Three-dimensional kinematic data and
              electromyography were collected in 14 young (25$\pm$6 years) and
              10 older adults (68$\pm$3 years) during second-long reaches to
              three targets aligned vertically in front of the participants.
              Older adults took longer to initiate a movement than the young
              adults and were more variable and inaccurate in their initial and
              final movements. Target height had greater effect on trajectory
              curvature variability in older than young adults, with angle
              variability relative to target position being greater in older
              adults around the time of peak speed. There were significant
              age-related differences in use of the multiple degrees of freedom
              of the upper extremity, with less variability in shoulder
              abduction in the older group. Muscle activation patterns were
              similar, except for a higher biceps-triceps co-contraction and
              tonic levels of some proximal muscle activation. The path length
              of movements was not affected by age. These results show an
              age-related deficit in the motor planning and online correction
              of reaching movements against a predictable force (i.e.,
              gravity). These results will facilitate interpretation of our
              forthcoming study of transcranial magnetic stimulation effects on
              the same task in these two populations, and is relevant to any

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Muscle co-contraction is the simultaneous contraction
              of agonist and antagonist muscles crossing a joint, and it
              increases with age. This study primarily aimed to clarify the
              difference in the effect of a light fingertip contact to
              stationary surface on postural sway and muscle co-contraction
              during single-leg standing (SLS) between young and elderly
              groups; the secondary aim was to reveal the quantitative
              difference in the muscle co-contraction of the ankle joint among
              the three different support structure conditions in the elderly
              group. METHODS: This study included eight young adults (age 23.4
              $\pm$ 2.6 years) and nine community dwelling older adults (age
              74.7 $\pm$ 3.4 years). The task was SLS under the following
              conditions: (1) no supporting structure, FR; (2) light index
              fingertip contact to a stationary supporting structure (to touch
              in force < 1 N), LT; and (3) dependence on a supporting structure
              for stabilization as desired, DO. Center of pressure (COP)
              variables [root-mean-square distance (RDIST), total excursion
              (TOTEX), mean velocity (MVELO), and standard deviation area
              (AREA-SD)] and the co-contraction index (CI) between the tibialis
              anterior and soleus were measured using surface electromyography.
              RESULTS: With regard to the effect of the light fingertip contact
              to stationary surface, in the young group, TOTEX, MVELO, AREA-SD,
              and CI during SLS were smaller under the LT condition than under
              the FR condition. However, in the elderly group, only AREA-SD and
              CI were smaller under the LT condition than under the FR
              condition. No significant difference was observed in COP
              variables and CI under the DO condition between the young and
              elderly groups. CONCLUSION: Both young and elderly groups could
              decrease muscle co-contraction using the light fingertip contact.
              On the other hand, in the elderly group, COP variables showed a
              limited effect from the light fingertip contact; only the
              ``sway'' domain measure (AREA-SD). Both young and elderly groups
              showed the smallest CI under the DO condition. Therefore, the
              elderly group could decrease muscle co-contraction of the ankle
              joint depending on postural stability.",

  abstract  = "Cocontraction (the simultaneous activation of antagonist muscles
               around a joint) provides the nervous system with a way to adapt
               the mechanical properties of the limb to changing task
               requirements?both in statics and during movement. However,
               relatively little is known about the conditions under which the
               motor system modulates limb impedance through cocontraction. The
               goal of this study was to test for a possible relationship
               between cocontraction and movement accuracy in multi-joint limb
               movements. The electromyographic activity of seven single- and
               double-joint shoulder and elbow muscles was recorded using
               surface electrodes while subjects performed a pointing task in a
               horizontal plane to targets that varied randomly in size.
               Movement speed was controlled by providing subjects with
               feedback on a trial-to-trial basis. Measures of cocontraction
               were estimated both during movement and during a 200-ms window
               immediately following movement end. We observed an inverse
               relationship between target size and cocontraction: as target
               size was reduced, cocontraction activity increased. In addition,
               trajectory variability decreased and endpoint accuracy improved.
               This suggests that, although energetically expensive,
               cocontraction may be a strategy used by the motor system to
               facilitate multi-joint arm movement accuracy. We also observed a
               general trend for cocontraction levels to decrease over time,
               supporting the idea that cocontraction and associated limb
               stiffness are reduced over the course of practice.",

  abstract  = "Aging typically leads to an increased risk for falls. Fall risk
               has been associated with, amongst other variables, a decline in
               muscle strength and power. An accepted model to assess one's
               ability to recover balance is with a perturbation of quiet
               stance through the release of a horizontal tether pulling at the
               waist. PURPOSE: To examine ankle muscle co-contraction levels in
               young and older adults during static held maximum voluntary
               contraction (MVC), rate of force development (RFD), as well as
               prior to and during an induced perturbation. METHODS: 18 healthy
               adult women (9 young: 22.3+3.3 yrs and 9 older: 75.2+4.2 yrs)
               with no history of falls or injury performed a minimum of 3
               trials each of isometric MVC where force was ramped to and held
               at maximum and RFD where force was built as quickly as possible
               from rest for both plantar flexion (PF) and dorsiflexion (DF).
               The perturbation trials were then performed where they recovered
               balance using the ankle strategy. Surface electromyography
               (sEMG) data were analyzed to compare co-contraction activity
               between groups. RESULTS: Height, body weight, and foot length
               were similar between groups (p>0.05). After normalizing for
               height, weight, and foot length, there were no differences
               between groups for muscle strength characteristics for PF and DF
               isometric trials (p>0.05). sEMG parameters were normalized using
               the PF MVC for the gastrocnemius (GAS) and soleus (SOL) and the
               DF MVC for the tibialis anterior (TA). No sEMG differences were
               found between groups for PF MVC, PF RFD, and DF RFD for all
               muscles (p>0.05). DF MVC showed significantly more
               co-contracting GAS activity for the young (young: 25.8+8.6\%,
               older: 11.8+3.1\%), (p=0.001) but not for SOL (young:
               37.3+12.2\%, older: 34.5+12.8\%) or TA activity (young 66.9+9.1,
               older: 66.31+7.2\%), (p>0.05). Perturbation sEMG showed no
               significant interactions or main effects for GAS and SOL between
               time and age (p>0.05). TA activity did show a significant
               interaction (p=0.001). Simple main effects at each time point
               comparison between the young and older showed significantly more
               TA activity in the older adults at 300-400ms after load release
               (young: 23.5+5.8\%, older: 38.7+9.4\%), (p=0.001) but nowhere
               else (p>0.098). Additionally the electromechanical delay (EMD)
               between torque and onset of muscle activity approached
               significance for the GAS (young: 0.064+0.009\%, older:
               0.071+0.01\%), (p=0.053). CONCLUSIONS: As expected the older
               adults showed more TA antagonistic co-contraction during balance
               recovery. Unexpectedly the young adults showed more GAS activity
               during DF MVC without a significant difference in force output.
               The approaching significance of GAS EMD also shows evidence of
               age-related neuromuscular changes taking place. However because
               of the lack of difference in strength and rate of force
               development between the two age groups the additional
               antagonistic torque produced by the older adults may be
               compromising the balance recovery process. In less physically
               capable older adults, the differences seen in TA activity and
               EMD may cause problems in recovering balance from perturbations.",

  abstract  = "Little is known about the integration of neural mechanisms for
               balance and locomotion. Muscle synergies have been studied
               independently in standing balance and walking, but not compared.
               Here, we hypothesized that reactive balance and walking are
               mediated by a common set of lower-limb muscle synergies. In
               humans, we examined muscle activity during multidirectional
               support-surface perturbations during standing and walking, as
               well as unperturbed walking at two speeds. We show that most
               muscle synergies used in perturbations responses during standing
               were also used in perturbation responses during walking,
               suggesting common neural mechanisms for reactive balance across
               different contexts. We also show that most muscle synergies
               using in reactive balance were also used during unperturbed
               walking, suggesting that neural circuits mediating locomotion
               and reactive balance recruit a common set of muscle synergies to
               achieve task-level goals. Differences in muscle synergies across
               conditions reflected differences in the biomechanical demands of
               the tasks. For example, muscle synergies specific to walking
               perturbations may reflect biomechanical challenges associated
               with single limb stance, and muscle synergies used during
               sagittal balance recovery in standing but not walking were
               consistent with maintaining the different desired center of mass
               motions in standing vs. walking. Thus, muscle synergies
               specifying spatial organization of muscle activation patterns
               may define a repertoire of biomechanical subtasks available to
               different neural circuits governing walking and reactive balance
               and may be recruited based on task-level goals. Muscle synergy
               analysis may aid in dissociating deficits in spatial vs.
               temporal organization of muscle activity in motor deficits.
               Muscle synergy analysis may also provide a more generalizable
               assessment of motor function by identifying whether common

              observed when performing difficult motor tasks. The benefit of
              co-contraction is thought to be zero-delay corrections to
              unexpected disturbances from increased intrinsic muscle
              impedance. We used upper-limb postural and tracking tasks to
              characterize the effects of co-contraction on motor corrections
              to loads applied to the limb. We systematically controlled
              pre-perturbation muscle activity and showed that co-contraction
              improves subsequent corrective responses in both tasks. However,
              substantial improvements in the corrective response are only
              observed at the time when neural feedback pathways can also
              contribute. We demonstrate that muscle impedance appears to play
              a minor role in improving performance. Instead, co-contraction
              engages a dual agonist-antagonist control strategy to counter
              disturbances, that is distinct from the control strategy used
              when not co-contracting or selectively pre-activating a single
              muscle group. Critically, we showed that this dual

               Although several studies have shown that reflexes in the muscle
               lengthened by a joint perturbation are modulated during
               co-contraction, little attention has been given to reflex
               regulation in the antagonist (shortened) muscle. The goal of the
               present study was to determine whether co-contraction gives rise
               to altered reflex regulation across the joint by examining
               reflexes in the muscle shortened by a joint perturbation.
               Reflexes were recorded from electromyographic activity in elbow
               flexors and extensors while positional perturbations to the
               elbow joint were applied. Perturbations were delivered during
               isolated activation of the flexor or extensor muscles as well as
               during flexor and extensor co-contraction. Across the group, the
               shortening reflex in the elbow extensor switched from
               suppression during isolated extensor muscle activation to
               facilitation during co-contraction. The shortening reflex in the
               elbow flexor remained suppressive during co-contraction but was
               significantly smaller compared to the response obtained during
               isolated elbow flexor activation. This response in the shortened
               muscle was graded by the level of activation in the lengthened
               muscle. The lengthening reflex did not change during
               co-contraction. These results support the idea that reflexes are
               regulated across multiple muscles around a joint. We speculate
               that the facilitatory response in the shortened muscle arises
               through a fast-conducting oligosynaptic pathway involving Ib

               relates the effects of age and skill level to motor control
               patterns of knee musculature co-contraction during functional
               movements. METHODS: A search of electronic databases was
               performed with the search terms specifying co-contraction
               (cocontract*, co-contract*, coactive* or co-activ*). The search
               was focused on the effects age and/or skill level and were
               limited by the keywords of age or skill level (skill*) or
               experience (experi*). RESULTS: The search yielded a total of six
               peer-reviewed manuscripts that met the search criteria and were
               included in the review. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between
               adequate dynamic joint stability and efficient movement patterns
               are complex. Co-contraction related to age and skill development
               varies among studies due to technical and practical
               considerations. Adequate antagonistic co-contraction of
               hamstring musculature seems to be a component of all functional
               movements, possibly maintain dynamic knee stability and protect
               against excessive joint loads. Future investigations that
               further delineate the appropriate lower extremity agonist and
               antagonist relationships during dynamic tasks may help elucidate
               injury risk mechanisms in specific populations.",

               to postural stability, they are perceived to operate
               independently of each other, In an antagonistic setup, agonist
               muscles contract generating moment about the joint, while
               antagonist muscles contract generating stiffness across the
               joint. While both work together in maintaining robustness in the
               face of external perturbations, contractions of agonist muscles
               and co-contractions of antagonistic muscle pairs across the
               ankle joint play different roles in responding to and adapting
               to external perturbations. To determine their respective roles,
               we exposed participants to repeated perturbations in both large
               and small magnitudes. The center of pressure (COP) and a
               co-contraction index (CCI) were used to quantify the activation
               of agonist muscles and antagonistic muscle pairs across the
               ankle joint. Our results found that participants generated
               moment of a large magnitude across the ankle joint-a large
               deviation in the COP curve-in response to perturbations of a
               large magnitude (p <0.05), whereas the same participants
               generated higher stiffness about the ankle-a larger value in
               CCI-in response to perturbations of a small magnitude (p <0.05).
               These results indicate that participants use different postural
               strategies pertaining to circumstances. Further, the moment
               across the ankle decreased with repetitions of the same
               perturbation (p <0.05), and CCI tended to remain unchanged even
               in response to a different perturbation following repetition of
               the same perturbation (p <0.05). These findings suggest that
               ankle muscle contraction and co-contraction play different roles
               in regaining and maintaining postural stability. This study
               demonstrates that ankle moment and stiffness are not correlated

               people who successfully compensate for the absence of an
               anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) (``copers'') are different from
               those of people who do not compensate well for the injury
               (``noncopers''). Early after injury, certain patients
               (``potential copers'') can increase the likelihood of
               successfully compensating for the injury by participating in 10
               sessions of perturbation training. The purpose of this study was
               to determine how perturbation training alters muscle
               co-contraction and knee kinematics in potential copers.
               SUBJECTS: Seventeen individuals with acute, unilateral ACL
               rupture who were categorized as potential copers and 17 subjects
               without injuries who were matched by age, sex, and activity
               level were recruited for this study. METHODS: Motion analysis
               and electromyographic data were collected as subjects walked
               across a stationary or moving platform (horizontal translation)
               before and after perturbation training. RESULTS: Before
               training, potential copers had higher co-contraction indexes and
               lower peak knee flexion angles than subjects without injuries.
               After training, potential copers' movement patterns more closely
               resembled those of subjects without injuries (ie, they showed
               reduced co-contraction indexes and increased peak knee flexion
               angles during stance). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Perturbation
               training reduced quadriceps femoris-hamstring muscle and
               quadriceps femoris-gastrocnemius muscle co-contractions and
               normalized knee kinematics in individuals with ACL rupture who
               were classified as potential copers. Findings from this study
               provide evidence for a mechanism by which perturbation training

               The aim of this study was to determine if training of the trunk

  abstract  = "During reaching movements in the presence of novel dynamics,
               participants initially co-contract their muscles to reduce
               kinematic errors and improve task performance. As learning
               proceeds, muscle co-contraction decreases as an accurate
               internal model develops. The initial co-contraction could affect
               the learning of the internal model in several ways. By ensuring
               the limb remains close to the target state, co-contraction could
               speed up learning. Conversely, by reducing kinematic errors, a
               key training signal, it could slow down learning. Alternatively,
               given that the effects of muscle co-contraction on kinematic
               errors are predictable and could be discounted when assessing
               the internal model error, it could have no effect on learning.

               generate accurate motor commands, or whether the brain avoids
               this by using the viscoelasticity of musculoskeletal system.
               Recent observations on relatively low stiffness during trained
               movements support the existence of internal models. However, no
               study has revealed the decrease in viscoelasticity associated
               with learning that would imply improvement of internal models as
               well as synergy between the two hypothetical mechanisms.
               Previously observed decreases in electromyogram (EMG) might have
               other explanations, such as trajectory modifications that reduce
               joint torques. To circumvent such complications, we required
               strict trajectory control and examined only successful trials
               having identical trajectory and torque profiles. Subjects were
               asked to perform a hand movement in unison with a target moving
               along a specified and unusual trajectory, with shoulder and
               elbow in the horizontal plane at the shoulder level. To evaluate
               joint viscoelasticity during the learning of this movement, we
               proposed an index of muscle co-contraction around the joint
               (IMCJ). The IMCJ was defined as the summation of the absolute
               values of antagonistic muscle torques around the joint and
               computed from the linear relation between surface EMG and joint
               torque. The IMCJ during isometric contraction, as well as during
               movements, was confirmed to correlate well with joint stiffness
               estimated using the conventional method, i.e., applying
               mechanical perturbations. Accordingly, the IMCJ during the
               learning of the movement was computed for each joint of each
               trial using estimated EMG-torque relationship. At the same time,
               the performance error for each trial was specified as the root
               mean square of the distance between the target and hand at each
               time step over the entire trajectory. The time-series data of
               IMCJ and performance error were decomposed into long-term
               components that showed decreases in IMCJ in accordance with
               learning with little change in the trajectory and short-term
               interactions between the IMCJ and performance error. A
               cross-correlation analysis and impulse responses both suggested
               that higher IMCJs follow poor performances, and lower IMCJs
               follow good performances within a few successive trials. Our
               results support the hypothesis that viscoelasticity contributes
               more when internal models are inaccurate, while internal models
               contribute more after the completion of learning. It is
               demonstrated that the CNS regulates viscoelasticity on a short-
               and long-term basis depending on performance error and finally
               acquires smooth and accurate movements while maintaining
               stability during the entire learning process.",

              few attempts to model the mechanisms underlying sensorimotor
              rehabilitation. We argue that a fundamental understanding of
              neurologic recovery, and as a result accurate predictions at the
              individual level, will be facilitated by developing computational
              models of the salient neural processes, including plasticity and
              learning systems of the brain, and integrating them into a
              context specific to rehabilitation. Here, we therefore discuss
              Computational Neurorehabilitation, a newly emerging field aimed
              at modeling plasticity and motor learning to understand and
              improve movement recovery of individuals with neurologic
              impairment. We first explain how the emergence of robotics and
              wearable sensors for rehabilitation is providing data that make
              development and testing of such models increasingly feasible. We
              then review key aspects of plasticity and motor learning that
              such models will incorporate. We proceed by discussing how
              computational neurorehabilitation models relate to the current
              benchmark in rehabilitation modeling - regression-based,
              prognostic modeling. We then critically discuss the first

              focused on modeling rehabilitation of the upper extremity after
              stroke, and show how even simple models have produced novel ideas

              see the emergence of mechanistic models of motor recovery that
              are informed by clinical imaging results and driven by the actual

              neurorehabilitation have long been linked by the intuition that
              understanding how we move (and learn to move) leads to better

              cortical responses in healthy young adults",
  author   = "Payne, Aiden M and Ting, Lena H",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Reactive balance recovery evokes a negative peak of
              cortical electroencephalography (EEG) activity (N1) that is
              simultaneous to brainstem-mediated automatic balance-correcting
              muscle activity. This study follows up on an observation from a
              previous study, in which N1 responses were larger in individuals
              who seemed to have greater difficulty responding to
              support-surface perturbations. RESEARCH QUESTION: We hypothesized
              that people engage more cortical activity when balance recovery
              is more challenging. We predicted that people with lower balance
              ability would exhibit larger cortical N1 responses during balance
              perturbations. METHODS: In 20 healthy young adults (11 female,
              ages 19-38) we measured the amplitude of the cortical N1 response
              evoked by 48 backward translational support-surface perturbations
              of unpredictable timing and amplitude. Perturbations included a
              Small (8 cm) perturbation that was identical across participants,
              as well as Medium (13-15 cm) and Large (18-22 cm) perturbations
              scaled to participant height to control for height-related
              differences in perturbation difficulty. To assess individual
              differences in balance ability, we measured the distance
              traversed on a narrow (0.5-inch wide) 12-foot beam across 6
              trials. We tested whether the cortical N1 response amplitude was
              correlated to balance ability across participants. RESULTS:
              Cortical N1 amplitudes in response to standing balance
              perturbations (54 $\pm$ 18 $\mu$V) were inversely correlated to
              the distance traveled in the difficult beam-walking task (R2 =
              0.20, p = 0.029). Further, there was a significant interaction
              between performance on the beam-walking task and the effect of
              perturbation magnitude on the cortical N1 response amplitude,
              whereby individuals who performed worse on the beam-walking task
              had greater increases in N1 amplitudes with increases in
              perturbation magnitude. SIGNIFICANCE: Cortical N1 response
              amplitudes may reflect greater cortical involvement in balance
              recovery when challenged. This increased cortical involvement may
              reflect cognitive processes such as greater perceived threat or
              attention to balance, which have the potential to influence
              subsequent motor control.",

               two types of human locomotion are likely to be controlled by
               shared pattern-generating networks. However, the differences
               between their kinematics and kinetics imply that corresponding
               muscle activations may also be quite different. We examined the
               differences between walking and running by recording kinematics
               and electromyographic (EMG) activity in 32 ipsilateral limb and
               trunk muscles during human locomotion, and compared the effects
               of speed (3?12 km/h) and gait. We found that the timing of
               muscle activation was accounted for by five basic temporal
               activation components during running as we previously found for
               walking. Each component was loaded on similar sets of leg
               muscles in both gaits but generally on different sets of upper
               trunk and shoulder muscles. The major difference between walking
               and running was that one temporal component, occurring during
               stance, was shifted to an earlier phase in the step cycle during
               running. These muscle activation differences between gaits did
               not simply depend on locomotion speed as shown by recordings
               during each gait over the same range of speeds (5?9 km/h). The
               results are consistent with an organization of locomotion motor
               programs having two parts, one that organizes muscle activation
               during swing and another during stance and the transition to
               swing. The timing shift between walking and running reflects
               therefore the difference in the relative duration of the stance
               phase in the two gaits.",

               addresses the outstanding questions that are critical to the
               translation of this technology into clinical and/or personal
               use. Prior research has demonstrated that the real-time use of
               visual, vibrotactile, auditory, and multimodal sensory
               augmentation technologies can improve balance during static and
               dynamic stance tasks within a laboratory setting. However, its
               application in improving gait requires additional investigation,
               as does its efficacy as a rehabilitation device for people with
               vestibular deficits. In some locomotor studies involving sensory
               augmentation, gait velocity decreased and secondary task
               performance worsened, and subjects negatively altered their
               segmental control strategies when cues were provided following
               short training sessions. A further question is whether the
               retention and/or carry-over effects of training with a sensory
               augmentation technology exceed the retention and/or carry-over
               effects of training alone, thereby supporting its use as a
               rehabilitation device. Preliminary results suggest that there
               are short-term improvements in balance performance following a
               small number of training sessions with a sensory augmentation
               device. Long-term clinical and home-based controlled training
               studies are needed. It is hypothesized that sensory augmentation
               provides people with vestibular deficits with additional sensory
               input to promote central compensation during a specific
               exercise/activity; however, research is needed to substantiate
               this theory. Major obstacles standing in the way of its use for
               these critical applications include determining
               exercise/activity specific feedback parameters and dosage
               strategies. This paper summarizes the reported findings that
               support sensory augmentation as a balance aid and rehabilitation
               device, but does not critically examine efficacy or the quality

               However, the neural correlates of age-related gait impairments
               are not fully understood yet.ObjectivesTo investigate (a) the
               effects of aging on prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity and gait
               parameters during usual walking, obstacle crossing and dual-task
               walking and (b) the association between PFC activity and
               measures of gait and executive function.MethodsEighty-eight
               healthy individuals were distributed into 6 age-groups: 20-25
               (G20), 30-35 (G30), 40-45 (G40), 50-55 (G50), 60-65 (G60), and
               70-75 years (G70). Participants walked overground under 3
               conditions: usual walking, obstacle crossing, and dual-task
               walking. Changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin in
               the PFC were recorded using functional near-infrared
               spectroscopy. Gait spatiotemporal parameters were assessed using
               an electronic walkway. Executive function was assessed through
               validated tests.ResultsBetween-group differences on PFC activity
               were observed for all conditions. Multiple groups (ie, G30, G50,
               G60, and G70) showed increased PFC activity in at least one of
               the walking conditions. Young adults (G20 and G30) had the
               lowest levels of PFC activity while G60 had the highest levels.
               Only G70 showed reduced executive function and gait impairments
               (which were more pronounced during obstacle crossing and
               dual-task walking). PFC activity was related to gait and
               executive function.ConclusionsAging causes a gradual increase in
               PFC activity during walking. This compensatory mechanism may
               reach the resource ceiling in the 70s, when reduced executive

  abstract  = "Purpose This paper aims to propose a bilateral robotic system
               for lower extremity hemiparesis rehabilitation. The hemiplegic
               patients can complete rehabilitation exercise voluntarily with
               the assistance of the robot. The reinforcement learning is
               included in the robot control system, enhancing the muscle
               activation of the impaired limbs (ILs) efficiently with ensuring
               the patients' safety.Design/methodology/approach A bilateral
               leader--follower robotic system is constructed for lower
               extremity hemiparesis rehabilitation, where the leader robot
               interacts with the healthy limb (HL) and the follow robot is
               worn by the IL. The therapeutic training is transferred from the
               HL to the IL with the assistance of the robot, and the IL
               follows the motion trajectory prescribed by the HL, which is
               called the mirror therapy. The model reference adaptive
               impedance control is used for the leader robot, and the
               reinforcement learning controller is designed for the follower
               robot. The reinforcement learning aims to increase the muscle
               activation of the IL and ensure that its motion can be mastered
               by the HL for safety. An asynchronous algorithm is designed by
               improving experience relay to run in parallel on multiple
               robotic platforms to reduce learning time.Findings Through
               clinical tests, the lower extremity hemiplegic patients can
               rehabilitate with high efficiency using the robotic system.
               Also, the proposed scheme outperforms other state-of-the-art
               methods in tracking performance, muscle activation, learning
               efficiency and rehabilitation efficacy.Originality/value Using
               the aimed robotic system, the lower extremity hemiplegic
               patients with different movement abilities can obtain better
               rehabilitation efficacy.",

  abstract  = "Lower limb exoskeleton (LLE) has received considerable interests
               in strength augmentation, rehabilitation and walking assistance
               scenarios. For walking assistance, the LLE is expected to have
               the capability of controlling the affected leg to track the
               unaffected leg's motion naturally. An important issue in this
               scenario is that the exoskeleton system needs to deal with
               unpredictable disturbance from the patient, which requires the
               controller of exoskeleton system to have the ability to adapt to
               different wearers. This paper proposes a novel Data-Driven
               Reinforcement Learning (DDRL) control strategy to adapt
               different hemiplegic patients with unpredictable disturbances.
               In the proposed DDRL strategy, the interaction between two lower
               limbs of LLE and the legs of hemiplegic patient are modeled in
               the context of leader-follower framework. The walking assistance
               control problem is transformed into a optimal control problem.
               Then, a policy iteration (PI) algorithm is introduced to learn
               optimal controller. To achieve online adaptation control for
               different patients, based on PI algorithm, an Actor-Critic
               Neural Network (ACNN) technology of the reinforcement learning
               (RL) is employed in the proposed DDRL. We conduct experiments
               both on a simulation environment and a real LLE system.
               Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed control
               strategy has strong robustness against disturbances and
               adaptability to different pilots.",

               assistance provided by a lower limb exoskeleton robot to
               patients in the gait rehabilitation training. The rehabilitation
               training robot with two lower limb exoskeletons is driven by the
               pneumatic proportional servo system and has two rotational
               degrees of freedom of each lower limb. An adaptive admittance
               model is adopted considering its suitability for human?robot
               interaction. The adaptive law of the admittance parameters is
               designed with Sigmoid function and the reinforcement learning
               algorithm. Individualized admittance parameters suitable for
               patients are obtained by reinforcement learning. Experiments in
               passive and active rehabilitation training modes were carried
               out to verify the proposed control method. The passive
               rehabilitation training experimental results verify the
               effectiveness of the inner-loop position control strategy, which
               can meet the demands of gait tracking accuracy in rehabilitation

              motion analysis, such as kinematic or electromyography (EMG)
              noise and unknown model parameters. Here we explore feasibility
              of RL to assist joint moment estimation for biomechanical
              applications. Forearm and hand kinematics and forearm EMGs from 4
              muscles during free finger and wrist movement were collected from
              six healthy subjects. Using the Proximal Policy Optimization
              approach, we trained and tested two types of RL agents that
              estimated joint moment based on measured kinematics or measured
              EMGs, respectively. To quantify the performance of RL agents, the
              estimated joint moment was used to drive a forward dynamic model
              for estimating kinematics, which were then compared with measured
              kinematics. The results demonstrated that both RL agents can
              accurately reproduce wrist and metacarpophalangeal joint motion.
              The correlation coefficients between estimated and measured
              kinematics, derived from the kinematics-driven agent and
              subject-specific EMG-driven agents, were 0.98$\pm$0.01 and
              0.94$\pm$0.03 for the wrist, respectively, and were 0.95$\pm$0.02
              and 0.84$\pm$0.06 for the metacarpophalangeal joint,
              respectively. In addition, a biomechanically reasonable joint
              moment-angle-EMG relationship (i.e. dependence of joint moment on
              joint angle and EMG) was predicted using only 15 seconds of
              collected data. In conclusion, this study serves as a proof of
              concept that an RL approach can assist in biomechanical analysis
              and human-machine interface applications by deriving joint
              moments from kinematic or EMG data.",

              sensorimotor rhythm (SMR)-with its arch-shaped waveform in alpha-
              and betabands-that reflect sensorimotor activity. The
              representation of sensorimotor activity by the SMR depends on the
              signal-to-noise ratio achieved by EEG spatial filters. New method
              We employed simultaneous recording of EEG and functional magnetic
              resonance imaging, and 10-min resting-state brain activities were
              recorded in 19 healthy volunteers. To compare the EEG
              spatial-filtering methods commonly used for extracting
              sensorimotor cortical activities, we assessed nine different
              spatial-filters: a default reference of EEG amplifier system, a
              common average reference (CAR), small-, middle- and
              large-Laplacian filters, and four types of bipolar manners
              (C3-Cz, C3-F3, C3-P3, and C3-T7). We identified the brain region
              that correlated with the EEG-SMR power obtained after each
              spatial-filtering method was applied. Subsequently, we calculated
              the proportion of the significant voxels in the sensorimotor
              cortex as well as the sensorimotor occupancy in all significant
              regions to examine the sensitivity and specificity of each
              spatial-filter. Results The CAR and large-Laplacian

              ratios for extracting sensorimotor activity from the EEG-SMR
              signal. Comparison with existing methods Our results are
              consistent with the spatial-filter selection to extract
              task-dependent activation for better control of EEG-SMR-based
              interventions. Our approach has the potential to identify the
              optimal spatial-filter for EEG-SMR. Conclusions Evaluating
              spatial-filters for extracting spontaneous sensorimotor activity
              from the EEG is a useful procedure for constructing more
              effective EEG-SMR-based interventions.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Localization of epileptic seizures, usually
              characterized by abnormal hypersynchronous wave patterns from the
              cortex, remains elusive. We present a novel, robust method for
              automatic localization of seizures on the scalp from clinical
              electroencephalogram (EEG) data. METHODS: Seizure patient EEG
              data was decomposed via the Hilbert Transform and processed
              through the following methodology: sorting the analytic amplitude
              (AA) in the time instance, locating the maximum amplitude within
              the vector of channels, cross-correlating amplitude values in the
              time index with the channel vector. The channel with highest AA
              value in time was located. RESULTS: Our approach provides an
              automated way to isolate the epi-genesis of seizure events with
              93.3\% precision and 100\% sensitivity. The method differentiates
              seizure-related neural activity from other common EEG noise
              artifacts (e.g., blinks, myogenic noise). CONCLUSIONS: We
              evaluated performance characteristics of our source location
              methodology utilizing both phase and energy of EEG signals from
              patients who exhibited seizure events. Feasibility of the new
              algorithm is demonstrated and confirmed. SIGNIFICANCE: The
              proposed method contributes to high-performance scalp
              localization for seizure events that is more straightforward and
              less computationally intensive than other methods (e.g., inverse
              source modeling). Ultimately, it may aid clinicians in providing
              improved patient diagnosis.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The supplementary motor area (SMA) is implicated in
              both motor initiation and stereotypic multi-limb movements such
              as walking with arm swing. Gait in Parkinson's disease exhibits
              starting difficulties and reduced arm swing, consistent with
              reduced SMA activity. OBJECTIVE: We tested whether enhanced arm
              swing could improve Parkinson gait initiation and assessed
              whether increased SMA activity during preparation might
              facilitate such improvement. METHODS: Effects of instructed arm
              swing on cortical activity, muscle activity and kinematics were
              assessed by ambulant EEG, EMG, accelerometers and video in 17
              Parkinson patients and 19 controls. At baseline, all participants
              repeatedly started walking after a simple auditory cue. Next,
              patients started walking at this cue, which now meant starting
              with enhanced arm swing. EEG changes over the putative SMA and
              leg motor cortex were assessed by event related spectral
              perturbation (ERSP) analysis of recordings at Fz and Cz. RESULTS:
              Over the putative SMA location (Fz), natural PD gait initiation
              showed enhanced alpha/theta synchronization around the auditory
              cue, and reduced alpha/beta desynchronization during gait
              preparation and movement onset, compared to controls. Leg muscle
              activity in patients was reduced during preparation and movement
              onset, while the latter was delayed compared to controls. When
              starting with enhanced arm swing, these group differences
              virtually disappeared. CONCLUSION: Instructed arm swing improves
              Parkinson gait initiation. ERSP normalization around the cue
              indicates that the attributed information may serve as a
              semi-internal cue, recruiting an internalized motor program to
              overcome initiation difficulties.",

              processes beyond just perturbed gait. Using a perturbed recumbent
              stepping protocol, we hypothesized motor errors and anterior
              cingulate activity would decrease with time, and perturbation
              timing would influence electrocortical elicitation. Young adults
              (n=17) completed four 10-minute arms and legs stepping tasks,
              with perturbations applied at every left or right leg
              extension-onset or mid-extension. A random no-perturbation
              ``catch'' stride occurred in every five perturbed strides. We
              instructed subjects to follow a pacing cue and to step smoothly,
              and we quantified temporal and spatial motor errors. We used
              high-density electroencephalography to estimate sources of
              electrocortical fluctuations shared among >70\% of subjects.
              Temporal and spatial errors did not decrease from early to late
              for either perturbed or catch strides. Interestingly, spatial
              errors post-perturbation did not return to pre-perturbation
              levels, suggesting use-dependent learning occurred. Theta (3-8
              Hz) synchronization in the anterior cingulate cortex and left and
              right supplementary motor areas (SMA) emerged near the
              perturbation event, and extension-onset perturbations elicited
              greater theta-band power than mid-extension perturbations. Even
              though motor errors did not adapt, anterior cingulate theta
              synchronization decreased from early to late perturbed strides,
              but only during the right-side tasks. Additionally, SMA mainly
              demonstrated specialized, not contralateral, lateralization.
              Overall, seated locomotor perturbations produced differential
              theta-band responses in the anterior cingulate and SMAs,
              suggesting that tuning perturbation parameters, e.g., timing, can
              potentially modify electrocortical responses.",

              tasks utilized mechanical perturbations to invoke feet-in-place
              responses (27 out of 38 studies), while cognitive dual-task

              enhanced brain activation during static balance control, that in

  author   = "Castano, Cesar R and Huang, Helen J",
  abstract = "Self-paced treadmills are being used more and more to study
              humans walking with their self-selected gaits on a range of
              slopes. There are multiple options to purchase a treadmill with
              or implement a custom written self-paced controller, which raises
              questions about how self-paced controller affect treadmill speed
              and gait biomechanics on multiple slopes. This study investigated
              how different self-paced treadmill controller sensitivities
              affected gait parameters and variability on a decline, level, and
              incline slopes. We hypothesized that increasing self-paced
              controller sensitivity would increase gait variability on each
              slope. We also hypothesized that detrended variability could help
              mitigate differences in variability that arise from differences
              in speed fluctuations created by the self-paced controllers. Ten
              young adults walked on a self-paced treadmill using three
              self-paced controller sensitivities (low, medium, and high) and
              fixed speeds at three slopes (decline, −10°; level, 0°; incline,
              +10°). Within each slope, average walking speeds and
              spatiotemporal gait parameters were similar regardless of
              self-paced controller sensitivity. With higher controller
              sensitivities on each slope, speed fluctuations, speed variance,
              and step length variance increased whereas step frequency
              variance and step width variance were unaffected. Detrended
              variance was not affected by controller sensitivity suggesting
              that detrending variability helps mitigate differences associated
              with treadmill speed fluctuations. Speed-trend step length
              variances, however, increased with more sensitive controllers.
              Further, detrended step length variances were similar for
              self-paced and fixed speed walking, whereas self-paced walking
              included substantial speed-trend step length variance not present
              in fixed speed walking. In addition, regardless of the self-paced
              controller, subjects walked fastest on the level slope with the
              longest steps, widest steps, and least variance. Overall, our
              findings suggest that separating gait variability into
              speed-trend and detrended variability could be beneficial for
              interpreting gait variability among multiple self-paced treadmill
              studies and when comparing self-paced walking with fixed speed
              walking. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have

              We aimed to examine factors that moderate test-retest reliability

              reliability in relation to poor adjustment of model order and
              signal length. Variation of discontinuity had no effect, but
              reliabilities were different between model orders, frequency

              documenting reliability, which may vary considerably between
              measures of interaction. We recommend careful selection of
              measures of interaction in accordance with the properties of the
              data. When only short data segments are available and when the
              signal length varies strongly across subjects after exclusion of
              artifacts, reliability becomes an issue. Finally, measures which
              show high reliability irrespective of the presence of artifacts
              could be extremely useful in clinical situations when exclusion
              of artifacts is impractical.",

               in this area is to find an appropriate corticomuscular feature
               which can not only drive an h-BCI but also serve as a biomarker
               for motor recovery monitoring. Our previous study established
               the feasibility of a new method of measuring corticomuscular
               co-activation called correlation of band-limited power
               time-courses (CBPT) of EEG and EMG signals, outperforming the
               traditional EEG-EMG coherence in terms of accurately controlling
               a robotic hand exoskeleton device by the stroke patients. In
               this paper, we have evaluated the neurophysiological
               significance of CBPT for motor recovery monitoring by conducting
               a 5-week long longitudinal pilot trial on 4 chronic hemiparetic
               stroke patients. Results show that the CBPT variations
               correlated significantly (p-value<; 0.05) with the dynamic
               changes in motor outcome measures during the therapy for all the
               patients. As the bandpower based biomarkers are popular in
               literature, a comparison with such biomarkers has also been made
               to cross-verify whether the changes in CBPT are indeed
               neurophysiological. Thus the study concludes that CBPT can serve
               as a biomarker for motor recovery monitoring while serving as a
               corticomuscular co-activation feature for h-BCI based
               neurorehabilitation. Despite an observed significant positive
               change between pre- and post-intervention motor outcomes, the
               question of the clinical effectiveness of CBPT is subject to

               processes following ischemic brain injury, where oxygen and

               ultimately neuronal death. A recent growing body of evidence,
               however, points to far-reaching pathophysiological consequences
               of acute ischemic stroke. Shortly after stroke onset, peripheral

               autonomic and neuroendocrine pathways and motor pathway

               challenging to address in the chronic stage of stroke (e.g.,
               greater than 6 months post stroke). Recent evidence suggests
               that physical therapy can still promote meaningful recovery
               after this stage, but the required high amount of therapy is
               difficult to deliver within the scope of standard clinical
               practice. Digital gaming technologies are now being combined
               with brain--computer interfaces to motivate engaging and
               frequent exercise and promote neural recovery. However, the
               complexity and expense of acquiring brain signals has held back
               widespread utilization of these rehabilitation systems.
               Furthermore, for people that have residual muscle activity,
               electromyography (EMG) might be a simpler and equally effective
               alternative. In this pilot study, we evaluate the feasibility
               and efficacy of an EMG-based variant of our REINVENT virtual
               reality (VR) neurofeedback rehabilitation system to increase
               volitional muscle activity while reducing unintended
               co-contractions. We recruited four participants in the chronic
               stage of stroke recovery, all with severely restricted active
               wrist movement. They completed seven 1-hour training sessions
               during which our head-mounted VR system reinforced activation of
               the wrist extensor muscles without flexor activation. Before and
               after training, participants underwent a battery of clinical and
               neuromuscular assessments. We found that training improved
               scores on standardized clinical assessments, equivalent to those
               previously reported for brain--computer interfaces.
               Additionally, training may have induced changes in corticospinal
               communication, as indexed by an increase in 12--30 Hz
               corticomuscular coherence and by an improved ability to maintain
               a constant level of wrist muscle activity. Our data support the
               feasibility of using muscle--computer interfaces in severe
               chronic stroke, as well as their potential to promote functional
               recovery and trigger neural plasticity.",

               created for sarcopenia screening; however, an international
               consensus is lacking. The Centers for Disease Control and
               Prevention have recently recognized that sarcopenia detection
               requires improved diagnosis and screening measures. Mounting
               evidence hints towards changes in the corticospinal
               communication system where corticomuscular coherence (CMC)
               reflects an effective mechanism of corticospinal interaction.
               CMC can be assessed during locomotion by means of simultaneously
               measuring Electroencephalography (EEG) and Electromyography
               (EMG). The aim of this study was to perform sarcopenia screening
               in community-dwelling older adults and explore the possibility
               of using CMC assessed during gait to discriminate between
               sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic older adults. Receiver Operating
               Characteristic (ROC) curves showed high sensitivity, precision
               and accuracy of CMC assessed from EEG Cz sensor and EMG sensors
               located over Musculus Vastus Medialis [Cz-VM; AUC (95.0\%CI):

               0.001]. These muscles showed significant differences with large
               magnitude of effect between sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic older
               adults [Hedge's g (95.0\%CI): 2.2 (1.3-3.1), p = 0.005 and
               Hedge's g (95.0\%CI): 1.5 (0.7-2.2), p = 0.010; respectively].
               The novelty of this exploratory investigation is the hint toward
               a novel possible determinant of age-related sarcopenia, derived
               from corticospinal control of locomotion and shown by the
               observed large differences in CMC when sarcopenic and
               non-sarcopenic older adults are compared. This, in turn, might
               represent in future a potential treatment target to counteract
               sarcopenia as well as a parameter to monitor the progression of
               the disease and/or the potential recovery following other

               example, while walking. Corticospinal control of gait can
               deteriorate during the aging process and CMC and intraMC may

               whether age-related differences may occur. Wireless surface

               pilot study with young and old adults during overground walking
               in two separate sessions. CMC and intraMC analyses were
               performed in the gathered beta and lower gamma frequencies
               (i.e., 13-40 Hz). Significant log-transformed coherence area was

               intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), yielding to low
               reliability in CMC in both younger and older adults. intraMC
               exclusively showed low reliability in the older adults, whereas
               intraMC in the younger adults revealed similar values as
               previously reported: test-retest reliability [ICC (95\% CI):
               0.44 (-0.23, 0.87); SEM: 0.46; MDC: 1.28; MDC\%: 103; Hedge's g
               (95\% CI): 0.54 (-0.13, 1.57)]. Significant differences between
               the age groups were observed in intraMC by either comparing the
               two groups with the first test [Hedge's g (95\% CI): 1.55 (0.85,
               2.15); p-value: .006] or with the retest data [Hedge's g (95\%
               CI): 2.24 (0.73, 3.70); p-value: .005]. Notwithstanding the
               small sample size investigated, intraMC seems a moderately
               reliable assessment in younger adults. The further development
               and use of this measure in practical settings to infer
               corticospinal interaction in human locomotion in clinical
               practice is warranted and should help to refine the analysis.
               This necessitates involving larger sample sizes as well as
               including a wider number of lower limb muscles. Moreover,
               further research seems warranted by the observed differences in
               modulation mechanisms of corticospinal control of gait as
               ascertained by intraMC between the age groups.",

               favoured a fully connected model. A reduced coupling from SMA
               and intact M1 in the $\gamma$-band (31-48 Hz) to lesioned M1 in
               the $\beta$-band (15-30 Hz) was observed in patients in the
               acute phase compared to controls. Behavioural performance
               improved significantly in the subacute phase, while an increased
               positive coupling from intact PMd to lesioned M1 and a less
               negative modulation from lesioned M1 to intact M1 were observed
               for patients compared to controls both from the $\gamma$-band to
               the $\beta$-band. We infer that the observed differences in

               intermuscular coherence in previously sedentary young (18-30
               years) and older (67-73 years) subjects before and after a
               14-week strength training intervention. YOUNG and OLDER groups
               performed maximum unilateral isometric knee extensions [100\%
               maximum voluntary contraction (MVC)], as well as force
               steadiness tests at 20 and 70\% MVC, pre- and post-training.
               Intermuscular (i.e., EMG-EMG) coherence analyses were performed
               for all (three) contraction intensities in vastus lateralis and
               medialis muscles. Pre-training coefficient of force variation
               (i.e., force steadiness) and MVC (i.e., maximum torque) were
               similar between groups. Both groups improved MVC through
               training, but YOUNG improved more than OLDER (42 $\pm$ 27 Nm
               versus 18 $\pm$ 16 Nm, P = 0.022). Force steadiness did not
               change during 20\% MVC trials in either group, but YOUNG
               demonstrated increased coefficient of force variation during
               70\% MVC trials (1.28 $\pm$ 0.46 to 1.57 $\pm$ 0.70, P = 0.01).
               YOUNG demonstrated greater pre-training coherence during 20\%
               and 70\% MVC trials, particularly within the 8-14 Hz (e.g.,
               20\%: 0.105 $\pm$ 0.119 versus 0.016 $\pm$ 0.009, P = 0.001) and
               16-30 Hz (20\%: 0.063 $\pm$ 0.078 versus 0.012 $\pm$ 0.007, P =
               0.002) bands, but not during 100\% MVC trials. Strength training
               led to increases in intermuscular coherence within the 40-60 Hz
               band during 70\% MVC trials in YOUNG only, while OLDER decreased
               within the 8-14 Hz band during 100\% MVC trials. Age-related
               differences in intermuscular coherence were observed between
               young and older individuals, even when neuromuscular performance

               intermuscular coherence remains unclear, since coherence within

               investigate the role of adaptations in the corticospinal pathway
               for motor recovery during the subacute phase after stroke.
               METHODS: We examined 19 patients with clinically diagnosed
               stroke and 18 controls. The patients had unilateral mild to
               moderate weakness of the hand. Each patient attended two
               sessions at approximately 3days (acute) and 38days post stroke
               (subacute). Task-related changes in the communication between

               to regaining fine motor control. Corticomuscular coherence (CMC)
               is a measure allowing to trace neuronal reorganizations which
               are functionally relevant for motor recovery. Contrary to
               previous studies which were performed only in chronic stage, we
               measured CMC in patients with stroke at both acute and chronic
               stroke stages. METHODS: For the detection of CMC we used
               multichannel EEG and EMG recordings along with an optimization
               algorithm for the detection of corticomuscular interactions.
               RESULTS: In acute stroke, the CMC amplitude was larger on the
               unaffected side compared to the affected side and also larger
               compared to the unaffected side in the chronic period.
               Additionally, CMC peak frequencies on both sides decreased in
               the acute compared to the chronic period and to control
               subjects. In chronic stage, there were no inter-hemispheric or
               group differences in CMC amplitude or frequency. CONCLUSIONS:
               The changes in CMC parameters in acute stroke could result from
               a temporary decrease in inhibition, which normalizes in the
               course of recovery. As all patients showed very good motor
               recovery, the modulation of CMC amplitude and frequency over
               time might thus reflect the process of motor recovery.

               changes of corticomuscular interaction both at acute and chronic

               occurs particularly during weak to moderate isometric
               contraction. It is a well-established measure of communication
               between the primary motor cortex (M1) and corresponding muscles
               revealing information about the integrity of the pyramidal
               system. Although the slowing of brain and muscle dynamics during
               healthy aging has been evidenced, functional communication as
               determined by CMC has not been investigated so far. Since
               decline of motor functions at higher age is likely to be
               associated with CMC changes, the present study aims at shedding
               light on the functionality of the motor system from a functional
               interaction perspective. To this end, CMC was investigated in 27
               healthy subjects aging between 22 and 77 years during isometric
               contraction of their right forearm. Neuromagnetic activity was
               measured using whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG). Muscle
               activity was measured by means of surface electromyography (EMG)
               of the right extensor digitorum communis (EDC) muscle.
               Additionally, MEG-EMG phase lags were calculated in order to
               estimate conducting time. The analysis revealed CMC and M1 power
               amplitudes to be increased with age accompanied by slowing of
               M1, EMG, and CMC. Frequency changes were particularly found in
               subjects aged above 40 years suggesting that at this middle age,
               neurophysiological changes occur, possibly reflecting an early
               neurophysiological marker of seniority. Since MEG--EMG phase
               lags did not vary with age, changes cannot be explained by
               alterations of nerve conduction. We argue that the M1 power
               amplitude increase and the shift towards lower frequencies might
               represent a neurophysiological marker of healthy aging which is
               possibly compensated by increased CMC amplitude.",

  abstract = "Abstract Background Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating
              neurodegenerative disorder. PD can be treated with deep brain
              stimulation (DBS) when dopaminergic medication is no longer a
              viable option. Both treatments are effective in improving motor
              symptoms, however, their underlying mechanisms are not fully
              elucidated yet.Objectives To study the effects of DBS and
              dopaminergic medication treatments on cortical processing and
              corticomuscular drive during movements.Methods
              Magnetoencephalography (MEG) was recorded in 10 PD patients and
              10 healthy controls, performing phasic hand contractions (hand
              gripping). Measurements were performed in DBS-treated, untreated
              and dopaminergic-medicated states; healthy controls received no
              treatment interventions. Participants performed phasic
              contractions with their right hand, recorded with
              electromyography (EMG). Our measures of interest were beta (13-30
              Hz) corticomuscular coherence (CMC) and low-gamma (31-45 Hz)
              power. We used Bayesian statistics on summary values from sensor
              space data, and we localized the sources of the effects of
              treatments on beta-CMC and low-gamma power using
              beamforming.Results In PD patients, DBS led to reduced CMC
              values, whereas dopaminergic medication increased beta-CMC values
              (localized to contralateral M1) to even higher levels than the
              controls. DBS, on the other hand, increased low-gamma power
              (localized to M1) compared to controls and to other conditions.
              Yet both treatments had similar beneficial effects on the
              patients' motor symptoms evaluated by UPDRS-III.Conclusion
              Despite comparable improvements from both treatments on motor

  abstract = "Motor dysfunction is a major consequence after stroke and it is
              generally believed that the loss of motor ability is caused by
              the impairments in neural network that controls movement. To
              explore the abnormal mechanisms how the brain controls shoulder
              abduction and elbow flexion in ``flexion synergy'' following
              stroke, we used the functional corticomuscular coupling (FCMC)
              between the brain and the muscles as a tool to identify the
              temporal evolution of corticomuscular interaction between the
              synkinetic and separate phases. 59-channel electroencephalogram
              (EEG) over brain scalp and 2-channel electromyogram (EMG) from
              biceps brachii (BB)/deltoid (DT) were recorded in sixteen stroke
              patients with motor dysfunction and eight healthy controls during
              a task of uplifting the arm (stage 1) and maintaining up to the
              chest (stage 2). As a result, compared to healthy controls,
              stroke patients had abnormally reduced coherence in EEG-BB
              combination and increased coherence in EEG-DT combination.
              Compared to synkinetic stroke patients, separate ones exhibited
              higher coupling at gamma-band during stage 1 and higher at
              beta-band during stage 2 in EEG-BB combination, but lower at
              beta-band during stage 2 in EEG-DT combination. Therefore, we
              infer that the disorders of efferent control and afferent
              proprioception in sensorimotor system for stroke patients effect
              on the oscillation at beta and gamma bands. Patients need
              integrate more information for shoulder abduction to compensate
              for the functional loss of elbow flexion in the recovery process,
              so that partial cortical cortex controlling on the elbow flexion
              may work on the shoulder abduction during ``flexion synergy''.
              Such researches could provide new perspective on the temporal
              evolution of corticomuscular interaction after stroke and add to
              our understanding of possible pathomechanisms how the brain

  abstract = "Gait disturbances are common in individuals with Parkinson's
              disease (PD). Although the basic patterns of walking are thought
              to be controlled by the brainstem and spinal networks, recent
              studies have found significant corticomuscular coherence in
              healthy individuals during walking. However, it still remains
              unknown how PD affects the cortical control of muscles during
              walking. As PD typically develops in older adults, it is
              important to investigate the effects of both aging and PD when
              examining disorders in patients with PD. Here, we assessed the
              effects of PD and aging on corticomuscular communication during
              walking by investigating corticomuscular coherence. We recorded
              electroencephalographic and electromyographic signals in 10
              individuals with PD, 9 healthy older individuals, and 15 healthy
              young individuals. We assessed the corticomuscular coherence
              between the motor cortex and two lower leg muscles, tibialis
              anterior (TA) and medial gastrocnemius, during walking. Older and
              young groups showed sharp peaks in muscle activation patterns at
              specific gait phases, whereas the PD group showed prolonged
              patterns. Smaller corticomuscular coherence was found in the PD
              group compared with the healthy older group in the $\alpha$ band
              (8-12 Hz) for both muscles, and in the $\beta$ band (16-32 Hz)
              for TA. Older and young groups did not differ in the magnitude of
              corticomuscular coherence. Our results indicated that PD
              decreased the corticomuscular coherence during walking, whereas
              it was not affected by aging. This lower corticomuscular
              coherence in PD may indicate lower-than-normal corticomuscular
              communication, although direct or indirect communication is
              unknown, and may cause impaired muscle control during walking.NEW
              \& NOTEWORTHY Mechanisms behind how Parkinson's disease (PD)
              affects cortical control of muscles during walking remain
              unclear. As PD typically develops in the elderly, investigation
              of aging effects is important to examine deficits regarding PD.
              Here, we demonstrated that PD causes weak corticomuscular
              synchronization during walking, but aging does not. This
              lower-than-normal corticomuscular communication may cause
              impaired muscle control during walking.",

              magnitude of descending (cortex-to-muscle) coherence. This was

  author   = "Thoroughman, K A and Shadmehr, R",
  abstract = "Theoretical and psychophysical studies have suggested that humans
              learn to make reaching movements in novel dynamic environments by
              building specific internal models (IMs). Here we have found
              electromyographic correlates of internal model formation. We
              recorded EMG from four muscles as subjects learned to move a
              manipulandum that created systematic forces (a ``force field'').
              We also simulated a biomechanical controller, which generated
              movements based on an adaptive IM of the inverse dynamics of the
              human arm and the manipulandum. The simulation defined two
              metrics of muscle activation. The first metric measured the
              component of the EMG of each muscle that counteracted the force
              field. We found that early in training, the field-appropriate EMG
              was driven by an error feedback signal. As subjects practiced,
              the peak of the field-appropriate EMG shifted temporally to
              earlier in the movement, becoming a feedforward command. The
              gradual temporal shift suggests that the CNS may use the delayed
              error-feedback response, which was likely to have been generated
              through spinal reflex circuits, as a template to learn a
              predictive feedforward response. The second metric quantified
              formation of the IM through changes in the directional bias of
              each muscle's spatial EMG function, i.e., EMG as a function of
              movement direction. As subjects practiced, co-activation
              decreased, and the directional bias of each muscle's EMG function
              gradually rotated by an amount that was specific to the field
              being learned. This demonstrates that formation of an IM can be
              represented through rotations in the spatial tuning of muscle EMG
              functions. Combined with other recent work linking spatial
              tunings of EMG and motor cortical cells, these results suggest
              that rotations in motor cortical tuning functions could underlie
              representation of internal models in the CNS.",

               measured during maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) of the
               elbow flexors (EFs) and extensors (EEs) in 20 young (23 +/- 3
               yr) and 13 older (81 +/- 6 yr) healthy men. PCSA was determined
               using magnetic resonance imaging, and normalized force (NF) was
               calculated as the MVC/PCSA ratio. The PCSA was smaller in the
               old compared with the young men, more so in the EEs (28\%)
               compared with the EFs (19\%) (P < 0.001); however, the decline
               in MVC (approximately 30\%) with age was similar in the two
               muscle groups. Muscle activation was not different between the
               groups, but coactivation was greater (5\%) (P < 0.001) in the

               with young subjects. The relative maintenance of NF in the EEs
               compared with the EFs may be related to age-associated changes
               in the architecture of the triceps brachii muscle. In
               conclusion, although the decline in PCSA explained the majority
               of strength loss in the old men, additional factors such as
               greater coactivation or reduced specific tension also may have
               contributed to the age-related loss of isometric strength.",

               of this study was to investigate the effect of muscle
               coactivation during quiet standing on dynamic postural control.
               Seventy older adults (81.1 $\pm$ 7.2 years) participated in this
               study. Static postural control was evaluated by postural sway
               during quiet standing, whereas dynamic postural control was
               evaluated by the functional reach and functional stability
               boundary tests. Electromyography of the soleus (SOL) and
               tibialis anterior (TA) was recorded during quiet standing, then
               coactivation was evaluated using the co-contraction index (CI).
               We used multiple regression analysis to identify the effect of
               muscle coactivation during standing on each dynamic postural
               control variable using age, body mass index (BMI), gender, timed

               model to evaluate the effect of functional mobility on dynamic
               postural control with a fixed base. The multiple regression
               analysis revealed that CI during standing was significantly
               related to all of the dynamic postural control tasks. The
               functional reach distance was significantly associated with CI
               during standing, age and TUG (p<0.05). The functional stability
               boundary for forward and backward were associated only with CI
               during standing (p<0.05). This study revealed that muscle

  abstract  = "Since muscle coactivation increases the stiffness and stability
               of a joint, greater coactivation is likely during faster than
               slower movements. Very few studies, though, have been conducted
               to verify this hypothesis. Moreover, a large number of studies
               have examined coactivation of muscles surrounding the knee joint
               whereas there are few reports on the elbow joint. The aim of

               the elbow flexors and extensors during isokinetic concentric
               exercises and to investigate the influence of angular velocity
               on their activation. Twelve men participated in the study. The
               surface electromyographic signals (sEMG) were recorded from the
               biceps brachii (BB) and triceps brachii (TB) muscles during
               three maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVC) of elbow
               flexors and extensors and a set of three maximal elbow flexions
               and extensions each at 15 degrees, 30 degrees , 60 degrees, 120
               degrees, 180 degrees, and 240 degrees.s(-1). Normalized root
               mean square (RMS) of sEMG was calculated during the isokinetic
               phase of movement as an index of sEMG amplitude. During elbow
               flexion, the antagonist activation of BB averaged 16.2\% lower
               than TB, and this difference was statistically significant at
               all angular velocities. The normalized RMS values ranged from
               26.0\% +/- 19.0 at MVC to 37.8\% +/- 13.9 at 240 degrees.s(-1)
               for antagonist TB activation, and from 5.7\% +/- 5.2 at MVC to
               18.9\% +/- 8.6 at 240 degrees.s(-1) for antagonist BB
               activation. No influence of angular velocity on agonist and
               antagonist activity was found. Moreover, flexion and extension
               torques were both strongly affected by the amount of antagonist
               activation. The functional specialization of the two muscle
               groups could be responsible for the different levels of
               antagonist activation. The frequent use of BB, which is not
               assisted by gravity during daily activities, could lead to
               reduced coactivation due to a better functioning of the control
               system based upon reciprocal innervation. These findings may
               have significant implications in the design of rehabilitation
               programs directed to the elbow joint.",

               and [2] maximal eccentric hamstring contractions Hamstring
               antagonist EMG in [1] were converted into antagonist moment
               based on the EMG-moment relationships determined in [2] and vice
               versa. Since antagonist muscle coactivation was present in both
               [1] and [2] a set of related equations was constructed to yield
               the moment/EMG relationships for the hamstring and quadriceps
               muscles, respectively. The equations were solved separately for
               every 0.05 degrees knee joint angle in the 90-10 degrees range
               of excursion (0 degrees = full extension) ensuring that the
               specificity of muscle length and internal muscle lever arms were
               incorporated into the moment/EMG relationships established.
               Substantial hamstring coactivation was observed during
               quadriceps agonist contraction. This resulted in a constant
               level of antagonist hamstring moment of about 30 Nm throughout
               the range of motion. In the range of 30-10 degrees from full
               knee extension this antagonist hamstring moment corresponded to
               30-75\% of the measured knee extensor moment. The level of
               antagonist coactivation was 3-fold higher for the lateral (Bfcl)
               compared to medial (ST) hamstring muscles The amount of EMG
               crosstalk between agonist-antagonist muscle pairs was negligible
               (Rxy2<0.02-0.06). The present data show that substantial
               antagonist coactivation of the hamstring muscles may be present
               during slow isokinetic knee extension. In consequence
               substantial antagonist flexor moments are generated. The

              together the technology and data analysis tools to conduct
              simultaneous brain/body imaging during navigation in mobile
              conditions. Following the Mobile Brain/Body Imaging approach, we
              focus on landmark-based navigation in actively behaving young
              adults solving a virtual reality Y-maze task. The presented EEG
              analysis identifies exploitable neural signals from a specific
              network of brain regions that matches the state-of-the-art
              imaging literature of landmark-based navigation, revealing the
              concurrent activation of brain areas engaged in active, natural
              spatial navigation. In particular, we focus on the role of the
              retrosplenial cortex in visuo-spatial processing and coding. In
              line with previous evidence, we find behavioral modulations of
              neural processes during navigation, like attentional demand, as
              reflected in the alpha/gamma range and memory workload in the
              delta/theta range. Finally, our results show how the fine
              temporal resolution of mobile EEG recordings captures the time
              course of neuro-behavioral correlations, as participants actively
              interact with their environment. We confirm that combining mobile
              high-density EEG and biometric measures can help unravel the
              brain network and neural modulations subtending ecological

               certain time. This paper aims to classify active and inactive
               sources from the information that can be inferred from
               parameters of a dynamical model that captures characteristics of
               EEG time series. We propose a state-space model for explaining
               coupled dynamics of the source and EEG signals where EEG is a
               linear combination of sources according to the characteristics
               of volume conduction. Our model has a structure that the
               sparsity pattern of the model output matrix can indicate the
               position of active and inactive sources. With this assumption,
               the proposed estimation method consists of two steps. Firstly, a
               subspace identification method is performed to estimate the
               dynamic matrix of the model and the mapping matrix from the
               state variable to EEG output. Secondly, the estimation of the
               output matrix in the state-space model from the mapping matrix
               is solved by a group lasso problem to promote a sparsity
               pattern. As a result, nonzero rows of the output matrix
               represent active source that corresponding to EEG data. We
               verify the performance of our method on randomly generated data
               sets that represent realistic human brain activities in a fair
               setting. An acceptable accuracy of 95 - 98\% is obtained with a

              sensitivity to the inherently rewarding nature of social stimuli.
              Previous neuroimaging studies have indicated that autistic males
              do indeed display reduced neural activity to social rewards, but
              it is unknown whether this finding extends to autistic females,
              particularly as behavioral evidence suggests that affected
              females may not exhibit the same reduction in social motivation
              as their male peers. We therefore used functional magnetic
              resonance imaging to examine social reward processing during an
              instrumental implicit learning task in 154 children and
              adolescents (ages 8-17): 39 autistic girls, 43 autistic boys, 33
              typically developing girls, and 39 typically developing boys. We
              found that autistic girls displayed increased activity to
              socially rewarding stimuli, including greater activity in the
              nucleus accumbens relative to autistic boys, as well as greater
              activity in lateral frontal cortices and the anterior insula
              compared with typically developing girls. These results
              demonstrate for the first time that autistic girls do not exhibit
              the same reduction in activity within social reward systems as
              autistic boys. Instead, autistic girls display increased neural
              activation to such stimuli in areas related to reward processing
              and salience detection. Our findings indicate that a reduced
              sensitivity to social rewards, as assessed with a rewarded
              instrumental implicit learning task, does not generalize to
              affected female youth and highlight the importance of studying
              potential sex differences in autism to improve our understanding
              of the condition and its heterogeneity.",

               unloading with known and unknown direction of the perturbation.
               In particular, we tested two main hypotheses predicting
               contrasting changes in APAs and ASAs. The first hypothesis
               predicted no major changes in ASAs. The second hypothesis
               predicted delayed APAs with predominance of co-contraction
               patterns when perturbation direction was unknown. Healthy
               subjects stood on the force plate and held a bar with two loads
               acting in the forward and backward directions. They pressed a
               trigger that released one of the loads causing a postural
               perturbation. In different series, the direction of the
               perturbation was either known (the same load released in all
               trials) or unknown (the subjects did not know which of the two
               loads would be released). Surface electromyograms were recorded
               and used to quantify APAs, synergies stabilizing center of
               pressure coordinate (within the uncontrolled manifold
               hypothesis), and ASA. APAs and ASAs were seen in all conditions.
               APAs were delayed, and predominance of co-contraction patterns
               was seen under the conditions with unpredictable direction of
               perturbation. In contrast, no significant changes in synergies
               and ASAs were seen. Overall, these results show that
               feed-forward control of vertical posture has two distinct
               components, reflected in APAs and ASAs, which show qualitatively
               different adjustments with changes in predictability of the
               direction of perturbation. These results are interpreted within
               the recently proposed hierarchical scheme of the synergic
               control of motor tasks. The observations underscore the
               complexity of the feed-forward postural control, which involves
               separate changes in salient performance variables (such as
               coordinate of the center of pressure) and in their stability

               of balance impairments in Parkinson's disease (PD). Prior
               studies in carefully selected patients showed PD patients
               demonstrate earlier, longer, and larger antagonist muscle
               activation during reactive balance responses to perturbations.
               RESEARCH QUESTION: Here, we tested whether antagonist leg muscle
               activity was abnormal in a group of PD patients who were not
               selected for phenotype and most of whom had volunteered for
               exercise-based rehabilitation. METHODS: We compared antagonist
               activation during reactive balance responses to multidirectional
               support-surface translation perturbations in 31 patients with
               mild-moderate PD (age 68$\pm$9; H\&Y 1-3; UPDRS-III 32$\pm$10)
               and 13 matched individuals (age 65$\pm$9). We quantified
               modulation of muscle activity (i.e., the ability to activate and
               inhibit muscles appropriately according to the perturbation
               direction) using modulation indices (MI) derived from minimum
               and maximum EMG activation levels observed across perturbation
               directions. RESULTS: Antagonist leg muscle activity was abnormal
               in unselected PD patients compared to controls. Linear mixed
               models identified significant associations between impaired
               modulation and PD (P<0.05) and PD severity (P<0.01); models
               assessing the entire sample without referencing PD status
               identified associations with balance ability (P<0.05), but not
               age (P = 0.10). SIGNIFICANCE: Antagonist activity is increased
               during reactive balance responses in PD patients who are not
               selected on phenotype and are candidates for exercise-based
               rehabilitation. This activity may be a mechanism of balance

               ability to modify the trunk kinematics and muscle activity
               following unexpected waist lateral perturbations during gait
               initiation. METHODS: Ten young (25 $\pm$ 2 years) and ten older
               adults (73 $\pm$ 5 years) initiated locomotion from stance while
               a lateral pull was randomly applied to the pelvis. Two force
               plates were used to define the feet centre-of-pressure

               electromyography of cervical and thoracic erector spinae muscles

               aging, and also with a history of falling. Co-contraction during

               slip and examine the effect of the training on kinematic and
               muscular responses in older adults. Twenty-four older adults
               were involved in a laboratory study and randomly assigned to two
               groups (VR training and control). Both groups went through three
               sessions including baseline slip, training, and transfer of
               training on slippery surface. The training group experienced 12
               simulated slips using a visual perturbation induced by tilting a
               VR scene while walking on the treadmill and the control group
               completed normal walking during the training session. Kinematic,
               kinetic, and electromyography data were collected during all the
               sessions. Results demonstrated the proactive adjustments such as
               increased trunk flexion at heel contact after training. Reactive
               adjustments included reduced time to peak activations of knee
               flexors, reduced knee coactivation, reduced time to trunk
               flexion, and reduced trunk angular velocity after training. In
               conclusion, the study findings indicate that the VR training was
               able to generate a perturbation in older adults that evoked
               recovery reactions and such motor skill can be transferred to
               the actual slip trials.",

               falls and 7 nonfallers, were compared with 13 young adults. APAs
               were assessed during a mediolateral arm raise task in standing.
               Temporal organization of postural adjustments was quantified as
               latency of APAs in the contralateral external oblique, lumbar
               paraspinals, and gluteus medius relative to activation of the
               deltoid. Spatial organization was quantified as extent of
               synergistic coactivation between muscles. Volume and location of
               the muscle representations in motor cortex were mapped using
               transcranial magnetic stimulation. We found that older adults

               adults to utilize APAs and its effect on subsequent control of
               posture (CPAs). Ten elderly individuals were exposed to external
               predictable and unpredictable perturbations applied to the upper
               body in the sagittal plane. Body kinematics, electromyographic
               activity of 13 muscles, and ground reaction forces were analyzed
               during the anticipatory and compensatory phases of postural
               control. The elderly were capable of recognizing an upcoming
               predictable perturbation and activated muscles prior to it.
               However, the older adults used different muscle strategies and
               sequence of muscle recruitment than that reported in young
               adults. Additionally, when the perturbations were unpredictable,
               no APAs were seen which resulted in large CPAs and greater peak
               displacements of the center of pressure (COP) and center of mass

  abstract  = "How does the robust control of walking and balance break down
               during a fall? Here, as a first step in identifying the
               neuromuscular determinants of falls, we tested the hypothesis
               that falls and recoveries are characterized by differences in
               neuromuscular responses. Using muscle synergy analysis,
               conventional onset latencies, and peak activity, we identified
               differences in muscle coordination between older adults who fell
               and those who recovered from a laboratory-induced slip. We found
               that subjects who fell recruited fewer muscle synergies than
               those who recovered, suggesting a smaller motor repertoire.
               During slip trials, compared with subjects who recovered,
               subjects who fell had delayed knee flexor and extensor onset
               times in the leading/slip leg, as well as different muscle
               synergy structure involving those muscles. Therefore, the
               ability to coordinate muscle activity around the knee in a
               timely manner may be critical to avoiding falls from slips.
               Unique to subjects who fell during slip trials were greater
               bilateral (interlimb) muscle activation and the recruitment of a
               muscle synergy with excessive coactivation. These differences in
               muscle coordination between subjects who fell and those who
               recovered could not be explained by differences in gait-related
               variables at slip onset (i.e., initial motion state) or
               variations in slip difficulty, suggesting that differences in
               muscle coordination may reflect differences in neural control of
               movement rather than biomechanical constraints imposed by
               perturbation or initial walking mechanics. These results are the
               first step in determining the causation of falls from the
               perspective of muscle coordination. They suggest that there may
               be a neuromuscular basis for falls that could provide new
               insights into treatment and prevention. Further research
               comparing the muscle coordination and mechanics of falls and
               recoveries within subjects is necessary to establish the
               neuromuscular causation of falls. NEW \& NOTEWORTHY: A central
               question relevant to the prevention of falls is: How does the

               successful balance recoveries or the kinematics and kinetics of
               falls. Here, for the first time, we identified differences in
               the spatial and temporal coordination of muscles among older

               by optical flow perturbations. The prolonged exposure to these
               perturbations could promote reactive balance control and
               increased balance confidence in older adults, but this
               scientific premise has yet to be investigated. This proof of
               concept study was designed to investigate the propensity for
               time-dependent tuning of walking balance control and the
               presence of aftereffects in older adults following a single
               session of optical flow perturbation training. METHODS: Thirteen
               older adults participated in a randomized, crossover design
               performed on different days that included 10 min of treadmill
               walking with (experimental session) and without (control
               session) optical flow perturbations. We used electromyographic
               recordings of leg muscle activity and 3D motion capture to
               quantify foot placement kinematics, lateral margin of stability,
               and antagonist coactivation during normal walking (baseline),
               early (min 1) and late (min 10) responses to perturbations, and
               aftereffects immediately following perturbation cessation
               (post). RESULTS: At their onset, perturbations elicited 17\%
               wider and 7\% shorter steps, higher step width and length
               variability (+171\% and +132\%, respectively), larger and more
               variable margins of stability (MoS), and roughly twice the
               antagonist leg muscle coactivation (p-values<0.05). Despite
               continued perturbations, most outcomes returned to values
               observed during normal, unperturbed walking by the end of
               prolonged exposure. After 10 min of perturbation training and
               their subsequent cessation, older adults walked with longer and
               more narrow steps, modest increases in foot placement
               variability, and roughly half the MoS variability and antagonist
               lower leg muscle coactivation as they did before training.
               CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that older adults: (i) respond to
               the onset of perturbations using generalized anticipatory
               balance control, (ii) deprioritize that strategy following
               prolonged exposure to perturbations, and (iii) upon removal of
               perturbations, exhibit short-term aftereffects that indicate a
               lessening of anticipatory control, an increase in reactive
               control, and/or increased balance confidence. We consider this
               an early, proof-of-concept study into the clinical utility of
               prolonged exposure to optical flow perturbations as a training
               tool for corrective motor adjustments relevant to walking
               balance integrity toward reinforcing task-specific, reactive
               control and/or improving balance confidence in older adults.

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Although several studies have reported that muscle
               coactivation during postural control increases with age, the
               effect of higher muscle coactivation on standing postural
               response to perturbation is unknown. AIMS: To investigate
               whether higher muscle coactivation affects standing postural
               response to perturbation in older adults. METHODS: Thirty-four
               community-dwelling older participants were randomly assigned
               either to the coactivation group (CG), where muscle coactivation
               was increased intentionally, or to the non-coactivation group
               (NCG). The participants were instructed to stand on a force
               plate that moved forward or backward. Electromyography data were
               collected from the lower leg muscles. We requested the
               participants in the CG to increase the activity of their
               tibialis anterior, and to maintain this posture during the
               tasks. We moved the force plate with a constant amplitude and
               velocity, and measured kinematic data with a camera during the
               tasks. RESULTS: During forward transfer, the knee extension and
               hip flexion decreased in the CG after perturbation compared to
               NCG, and the trunk extension angle increased. The center of
               pressure (COP) displacement decreased around the peak of the
               movement in the CG compared to NCG. During backward transfer,
               ankle dorsal and knee flexion changed after perturbation in the
               CG compared to NCG. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our study found
               that higher muscle coactivation inhibits lower limb and COP
               movement as well as increases trunk tilt and the risk for falls
               during forward perturbations. Postural control with higher
               coactivation appears to be inefficient for maintaining balance
               during the backward sway of posture.",

  abstract  = "Older adults are at a high risk of falls, and most falls occur
               during locomotor activities like walking. This study aimed to
               improve our understanding of changes in neuromuscular control
               associated with increased risk of falls in older adults in the
               presence of dynamic balance challenges during walking. Motor
               module (also known as muscle synergy) analyses identified
               changes in the neuromuscular recruitment of leg muscles during
               walking with and without perturbations designed to elicit the
               visual perception of lateral instability. During normal walking
               we found that a history of falls (but not age) was associated
               with reduced motor module complexity and that age (but not a
               history of falls) was associated with increased step-to-step
               variability of module recruitment timing. Furthermore, motor
               module complexity was unaltered in the presence of optical flow
               perturbations. The specific effects of a history of falls on leg
               muscle recruitment included an absence and/or inability to
               independently recruit motor modules normally recruited to
               perform biomechanical functions important for walking balance
               control. These results suggest that fallers do not recruit the
               appropriate motor modules necessary for well-coordinated walking
               balance control even in the presence of perturbations. The
               identified changes in the modular control of walking balance in
               older fallers may either represent a neural deficit that leads
               to poor balance control or a prior history of falls that results
               in a compensatory motor adaptation. In either case, our study
               provides initial evidence that a reduced motor repertoire in
               older adult fallers may be a constraint on their ability to

               walking along a 5 m straight path and a 5 m circumference curved

               comparable decreases in turning velocity as compared with
               straight walking, but older adults decreased the second peak
               knee flexion instead of the second peak ankle plantarflexion,
               and the knee remained flexed during the loading response. Older

               facilitate turning, which were not seen in young adults.

               Walking speed and step length were measured. Electromyography
               (EMG) data were collected from the tibialis anterior and soleus

               without fear of falling, on the basis of a modified Falls

               associated with CI (p<0.01): CIs for subjects with fear and
               those without fear were 59.5 $\pm$ 12.2\% and 46.7 $\pm$ 8.5\%,
               respectively. CONCLUSION: Individuals with a fear of falling
               have increased muscular co-activation at the ankle joint during
               walking, at least in a certain subgroup of older adults. Further
               research is needed to clarify negative and positive effects of
               muscular coactivation during walking in fearful subjects.",

               populations, and their prevalence increases with age. Abnormal
               gait has been associated with greater risk for adverse outcomes
               in older adults, such as immobility and falls, which in turn
               lead to loss of functional independence and death. AIM: The
               purpose of this review was to evaluate all of the original
               papers that measured gait parameters in the healthy elderly
               subjects. METHOD: The search strategy was based on Population
               Intervention Comparison Outcome method. A search was performed
               in Pub Med, Science Direct, Google scholar, ISI web of knowledge
               databases by using the selected keywords. Forty-two articles
               were selected for final evaluation. The procedure using the
               PRISMA method was followed. RESULTS: Stride lengths of older
               subjects ranged between 135 and 153 cm, and they preferred to
               walk with a 41 \% increase in step width compared to young
               subjects. Cadence was reported to be between 103 and 112
               steps/min in older adults. They consumed an average of 20-30 \%
               more metabolic energy than younger subjects. All except one
               study demonstrated that older people have significantly reduced
               gait symmetry. CONCLUSION: The progression toward shorter steps
               and slower walking and increased step width and prolonged double
               support in older adult, may therefore emerge as a compensatory
               strategy aimed at increasing stability, avoiding falls, or

               This study examined the association between C(w) and agonist
               muscle activity and antagonist coactivity in young and old
               adults. METHODS: Young and old adults walked at 0.98 m/s on a
               treadmill set at 6\% decline, level, and 6\% incline, while C(w)
               and neural activation of leg muscles were measured. RESULTS:
               C(w) was 7.0\% (incline), 19.2\% (level), and 47.3\% (decline)
               higher in old adults (overall 18.3\%). Old (67.1\%) versus young
               (40.1\%) adults activated their leg muscles 67.3\% more during
               the gait tasks and had 152.8\% higher antagonist muscle
               coactivation (old: 67.1\%, young: 19.9\%). Agonist muscle
               activation was unrelated to C(w) on incline, but it explained up
               to 42\% (level), 48\% (decline), and 70\% (three tasks combined)
               of variance in C(w). Antagonist coactivation accounted for up to

               adaptations in the recruitment pattern of leg muscles during
               gait significantly contribute to the high C(w) in old adults.
               Clinical interventions optimizing the neural control of leg

              movements during reading and comprehension assessed after reading
              is surprisingly limited, especially for reading long connected
              texts. We tested two competing possibilities: (a) the weak
              association hypothesis: Links between eye movements and
              comprehension are weak and short-lived, versus (b) the strong

              movement features, using participant-level cross-validation to
              ensure that the models generalize across participants. We used
              data from three studies in which readers (Ns = 104, 130, 147)
              answered multiple-choice comprehension questions ~30 min after
              reading a 6,500-word text, or after reading up to eight

              comprehension across all studies. Furthermore, models trained on
              one study's data could successfully predict comprehension on the

              biomarkers (particularly biomarkers of diagnosis), reliability
              over short periods is critically important. In the field of
              autism spectrum disorder (ASD), resting electroencephalography
              (EEG) power spectral densities (PSD) are well-studied for their
              potential as biomarkers. Classically, such data have been
              decomposed into pre-specified frequency bands (e.g., delta,
              theta, alpha, beta, and gamma). Recent technical advances, such
              as the Fitting Oscillations and One-Over-F (FOOOF) algorithm,
              allow for targeted characterization of the features that
              naturally emerge within an EEG PSD, permitting a more detailed
              characterization of the frequency band-agnostic shape of each
              individual's EEG PSD. Here, using two resting EEGs collected a
              median of 6 days apart from 22 children with ASD and 25 typically
              developing (TD) controls during the Feasibility Visit of the
              Autism Biomarkers Consortium for Clinical Trials, we estimate
              test-retest reliability based on the characterization of the PSD
              shape in two ways: (1) Using the FOOOF algorithm we estimate six
              parameters (offset, slope, number of peaks, and amplitude, center
              frequency and bandwidth of the largest alpha peak) that
              characterize the shape of the EEG PSD; and (2) using
              nonparametric functional data analyses, we decompose the shape of
              the EEG PSD into a reduced set of basis functions that
              characterize individual power spectrum shapes. We show that
              individuals exhibit idiosyncratic PSD signatures that are stable
              over recording sessions using both characterizations. Our data
              show that EEG activity from a brief 2-min recording provides an
              efficient window into characterizing brain activity at the
              single-subject level with desirable psychometric characteristics
              that persist across different analytical decomposition methods.
              This is a necessary step towards analytical validation of
              biomarkers based on the EEG PSD and provides insights into
              parameters of the PSD that offer short-term reliability (and thus
              promise as potential biomarkers of trait or diagnosis) vs. those
              that are more variable over the short term (and thus may index
              state or other rapidly dynamic measures of brain function).
              Future research should address the longer-term stability of the
              PSD, for purposes such as monitoring development or response to
              treatment.",

              neurodevelopmental pathways that underpin individual differences

              association between a putative neurophysiological indicator of
              information encoding (change in frontal theta during a novel
              video) in infancy and later general cognitive outcome. In a
              discovery cohort of 12-month-old typically developing infants, we
              recorded EEG during presentation of dynamic movies of people and
              objects. Frontal theta power (3-6 Hz) significantly increased
              during the course of viewing each video. Critically, increase in
              frontal theta during viewing of a video was associated with a
              differential response to repetition of that specific video,
              confirming relation to learning. Further, individual differences
              in the magnitude of change in frontal theta power were related to
              concurrent nonverbal cognitive level. We then sought to extend
              this association in two independent samples enriched for
              variation in cognitive outcome due to the inclusion of infants at
              familial risk for autism. We observed similar patterns of theta
              EEG change at 12 months, and found a predictive relation to
              verbal and nonverbal cognitive skills measured at 2, 3 and 7
              years of age. For the subset of high-risk infants later diagnosed
              with autism, infant theta EEG explained over 80\% of the variance
              in nonverbal skills at age 3 years. We suggest that EEG theta
              change in infancy is an excellent candidate predictive biomarker
              that could yield substantial insight into the mechanisms that
              underlie individual differences in childhood intelligence,

              resistance applied against hip and knee movements. Subjects first
              walked on a treadmill with their lower limbs strapped to an
              exoskeletal robotic gait orthosis with no resistance against leg
              motions (null condition). Afterward, a velocity-dependent
              resistance was applied against left hip and knee movements (force
              condition). Catch trials were interspersed throughout the
              experiment to track the development of adaptive changes in the
              walking pattern. After 188 steps in the force condition, subjects
              continued to step in the null condition for another 100 steps
              (washout period). Leg muscle activity and joint kinematics were
              recorded and analyzed. The adaptive modifications in the
              locomotor pattern suggest the involvement of both feedback and
              feedforward control strategies. Feedback-driven adaptations were
              reflected in increases in rectus femoris and tibialis anterior
              activity during swing, which occurred immediately, only in the
              presence of resistance, and not during the catch trials.
              Locomotor adaptations involving feedforward strategies were
              reflected in enhanced pre-swing activity in the biceps femoris
              and medial hamstrings muscles, which required experience and
              persisted in the catch trials. During washout subjects showed a
              gradual deadaptation of locomotor activity to control levels. In
              summary, adaptive changes in the walking pattern were driven by
              both feedback and feedforward adjustments in the walking pattern
              appropriate for overcoming the effects of resistance.",

  abstract  = "Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings have been rarely
               included in large-scale studies. This is arguably not due to a
               lack of information that lies in EEG recordings but mainly on
               account of methodological issues. In many cases, particularly in
               clinical, pediatric and aging populations, the EEG has a high
               degree of artifact contamination and the quality of EEG
               recordings often substantially differs between subjects.
               Although there exists a variety of standardized preprocessing
               methods to clean EEG from artifacts, currently there is no
               method to objectively quantify the quality of preprocessed EEG.
               This makes the commonly accepted procedure of excluding subjects
               from analyses due to exceeding contamination of artifacts highly
               subjective. As a consequence, P-hacking is fostered, the
               replicability of results is decreased, and it is difficult to
               pool data from different study sites. In addition, in
               large-scale studies, data are collected over years or even
               decades, requiring software that controls and manages the
               preprocessing of ongoing and dynamically growing studies. To
               address these challenges, we developed Automagic, an open-source
               MATLAB toolbox that acts as a wrapper to run currently available
               preprocessing methods and offers objective standardized quality
               assessment for growing studies. The software is compatible with
               the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) standard and hence
               facilitates data sharing. In the present paper we outline the
               functionality of Automagic and examine the effect of applying
               combinations of methods on a sample of resting and task-based
               EEG data. This examination suggests that applying a pipeline of
               algorithms to detect artifactual channels in combination with
               Multiple Artifact Rejection Algorithm (MARA), an independent
               component analysis (ICA)-based artifact correction method, is
               sufficient to reduce a large extent of artifacts.",

              manipulated to modulate the magnitude, transfer, and washout of
              split-belt-induced learning in humans. Specifically, manipulating
              the availability of vision during training or testing phases of
              learning resulted in differences in adaptive mechanisms for
              temporal and spatial features of walking. However, multi-trial
              locomotor training has been rarely explored when using visual
              kinematic gait perturbations. In this study, we investigated
              multi-trial locomotor adaptation in ten healthy individuals while
              applying visual kinematic perturbations. Subjects were instructed
              to control a moving cursor, which represented the position of
              their heel, to follow a prescribed heel path profile displayed on
              a monitor. The perturbations were introduced by scaling all of
              the lower limb joint angles by a factor of 0.7 (i.e., a gain
              change), resulting in visual feedback errors between subjects'
              heel trajectories and the prescribed path profiles. Our findings
              suggest that, with practice, the subjects learned, albeit with
              different strategies, to reduce the tracking errors and showed
              faster response time in later trials. Moreover, the gait symmetry
              indices, in both the spatial and temporal domains, changed
              significantly during gait adaptation (P < 0.001). After-effects
              were present in the temporal gait symmetry index whens the visual
              perturbations were removed in the post-exposure period (P <
              0.001), suggesting adaptation learning. These findings may have

              walking pattern. For example, artificial optic flow can drive
              changes in step length during locomotion and may also be useful
              for augmenting locomotor training for individuals with gait
              asymmetries. Here we asked whether optic flow could modify the
              acquisition of a symmetric walking pattern during split-belt
              treadmill adaptation. Participants walked on a split-belt
              treadmill while watching a virtual scene that produced artificial
              optic flow. For the Stance Congruent group, the scene moved at
              the slow belt speed at foot strike on the slow belt and then
              moved at the fast belt speed at foot strike on the fast belt.
              This approximates what participants would see if they moved over
              ground with the same walking pattern. For the Stance Incongruent
              group, the scene moved fast during slow stance and vice versa. In
              this case, flow speed does not match what the foot is
              experiencing, but predicts the belt speed for the next foot
              strike. Results showed that the Stance Incongruent group learned
              more quickly than the Stance Congruent group even though each
              group learned the same amount during adaptation. The increase in
              learning rate was primarily driven by changes in spatial control
              of each limb, rather than temporal control. Interestingly, when
              this alternating optic flow pattern was presented alone, no
              adaptation occurred. Our results demonstrate that an unnatural
              pattern of optic flow, one that predicts the belt speed on the
              next foot strike, can be used to enhance learning rate during

              human participants (11 men and three women) standing during

              recording their visuo-postural tracking movements as a typical
              visually guided movement to explore differences of cortical
              process of VIPS from the voluntary visuomotor process involving
              the dorsal stream. In the visuo-postural tracking condition, the
              participants moved their center of pressure in time with a slowly
              oscillating (expanding, shrinking) target rectangle.
              Source-resolved results showed that alpha band (8-13 Hz) activity
              in the medial and right occipital cortex during VIPS was
              modulated by the direction and velocity of optic flow and

              source-resolved potentials from the parietal association cortex

              feedback (but no visual flow) in which the dorsal stream is
              involved, sensorimotor areas produced more theta band (4-7 Hz)
              and less beta band (14-35 Hz) activity than during involuntary
              VIPS. These results suggest that VIPS involves cortical field

               burst-suppression with an automated burst-suppression detection
               algorithm. We analyzed EEG data with multitaper spectral
               estimation methods. We assessed associations between patient
               characteristics and burst-suppression using Binomial and
               Zero-inflated Poisson Regression Models. RESULTS: We found
               significantly decreased alpha and beta power (7.8-22.95 Hz) in
               the CPB burst-suppression cohort. The odds ratio for the
               association between point estimates for alpha and beta power
               (7.8-22.95 Hz) and the incidence of burst-suppression was 0.88
               (95\% CI: 0.79-0.98). The incidence rate ratio for the
               association between point estimates for power between the alpha
               and beta range and the duration of burst-suppression was 0.89
               (95\% CI: 0.84-0.93). CONCLUSION: Decreased intra-operative
               power within the alpha and beta range was associated with
               susceptibility to burst-suppression during CPB. SIGNIFICANCE:
               This dynamic may be used to develop principled
               neurophysiological-based approaches to aid the preemptive
               identification and targeted care of POD vulnerable patients.",

               retirement, increased 1-year mortality, and long-term cognitive

               anesthesia and surgery place severe stress on the aging brain,
               and that patients with less ability to withstand this stress
               will be at increased risk for developing postoperative delirium
               and POCD. Delirium and POCD risk are increased in patients with
               lower preoperative cognitive function, yet preoperative
               cognitive function is not routinely assessed, and no
               intraoperative physiological predictors have been found that
               correlate with lower preoperative cognitive function. Since
               general anesthesia causes alpha-band (8-12 Hz)
               electroencephalogram (EEG) power to decrease occipitally and
               increase frontally (known as ``anteriorization''), and
               anesthetic-induced frontal alpha power is reduced in older
               adults, we hypothesized that lower intraoperative frontal alpha
               power might correlate with lower preoperative cognitive
               function. Here, we provide evidence that such a correlation
               exists, suggesting that lower intraoperative frontal alpha power
               could be used as a physiological marker to identify older adults
               with lower preoperative cognitive function. Lower intraoperative
               frontal alpha power could thus be used to target these at-risk

               postoperative delirium and POCD, or for increased postoperative
               monitoring and follow-up. More generally, these results suggest
               that understanding interindividual differences in how the brain
               responds to anesthetic drugs can be used as a probe of
               neurocognitive function (and dysfunction), and might be a useful

              by a single trial of exoskeleton-assisted gait in chronic stroke
              survivors. DESIGN: Study design was randomized crossover.
              Electroencephalographic data (64-channel system) were recorded
              before gait (baseline) and after unassisted overground walking
              and overground exoskeleton-assisted walking. Coherence was
              estimated for alpha1, alpha2, and beta frequency ranges. Graph

              betweenness centrality. RESULTS: Nine participants were included
              in the final analysis. In the group (four participants) with a
              left-hemisphere stroke lesion (dominant hemisphere), over the
              vertex, node strength increased in alpha1, alpha2, and beta
              bands, and betweenness centrality decreased in alpha2 both after
              unassisted overground walking and exoskeleton-assisted walking.
              In the group (five participants) with a right-hemisphere lesion

               how reliable are the responses evoked by a naturalistic
               audio-visual stimulus in each of these imaging methods, and
               second, how similar are stimulus-related responses across
               methods? To this end, we investigated a wide range of brain

               The fMRI signal correlated positively with high-frequency ECoG
               power across multiple task-related cortical structures but

               at frequencies above 70 Hz, play an important role in functional
               cortical mapping and as control signals for BCI (brain-computer
               interface) applications. Most studies of HG activity have used
               ECoG (electrocorticography) which provides high-quality
               spatially localized signals, but is an invasive method. Recent
               studies have shown that non-invasive modalities such as EEG and
               MEG can also detect task-related HG power changes. We show here
               that a 27 channel EEG (electroencephalography) montage provides
               high-quality spatially localized signals non-invasively for HG
               frequencies ranging from 83 to 101 Hz. We used a generic head
               model, a weighted minimum norm least squares (MNLS) inverse
               method, and a self-paced finger movement paradigm. The use of an
               inverse method enables us to map the EEG onto a generic cortex
               model. We find the HG activity during the task to be well
               localized in the contralateral motor area. We find HG power
               increases prior to finger movement, with average latencies of
               462 ms and 82 ms before EMG (electromyogram) onset. We also find
               significant phase-locking between contra- and ipsilateral motor
               areas over a similar HG frequency range; here the
               synchronization onset precedes the EMG by 400 ms. We also
               compare our results to ECoG data from a similar paradigm and
               find EEG mapping and ECoG in good agreement. Our findings
               demonstrate that mapped EEG provides information on two
               important parameters for functional mapping and BCI which are
               usually only found in HG of ECoG signals: spatially localized
               power increases and bihemispheric phase-locking.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Prediction of Gait intention from pre-movement
              Electroencephalography (EEG) signals is a vital step in
              developing a real-time Brain-computer Interface (BCI) for a
              proper neuro-rehabilitation system. In that respect, this paper
              investigates the feasibility of a fully predictive methodology to
              detect the intention to start and stop a gait cycle by utilizing
              EEG signals obtained before the event occurrence. METHODS: An
              eight-channel, custom-made, EEG system with electrodes placed
              around the sensorimotor cortex was used to acquire EEG data from
              six healthy subjects and two amputees. A discrete wavelet
              transform-based method was employed to capture event related
              information in alpha and beta bands in the time-frequency domain.
              The Hjorth parameters, namely activity, mobility, and complexity,
              were extracted as features while a two-sample unpaired Wilcoxon
              test was used to get rid of redundant features for better
              classification accuracy. The feature set thus obtained was then
              used to classify between 'walk vs. stop' and 'rest vs. start'
              classes using support vector machine (SVM) classifier with RBF
              kernel in a ten-fold cross-validation scheme. RESULTS: Using a
              fully predictive intention detection system, 76.41$\pm$4.47\%
              accuracy, 72.85$\pm$7.48\% sensitivity, and 79.93$\pm$5.50\%
              specificity were achieved for 'rest vs. start' classification.
              While for 'walk vs. stop' classification, the obtained mean
              accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 74.12$\pm$4.12\%,
              70.24$\pm$6.45\%, and 77.78$\pm$7.01\% respectively. Overall
              average True Positive Rate achieved by this methodology was
              72.06$\pm$8.27\% with 1.45 False Positives/min. CONCLUSION:
              Extensive simulations and resulting classification results show
              that it is possible to achieve statistically similar intention
              detection accuracy using either only pre-movement EEG features or
              trans-movement EEG features. The classifier performance shows the
              potential of the proposed methodology to predict human movement
              intention exclusively from the pre-movement EEG signal to be
              applied in real-life prosthetic and neuro-rehabilitation systems.",

              overweight/obesity aged 8-11 years participated in this
              cross-sectional study. Physical fitness components were assessed
              using the ALPHA test battery. Electroencephalography recordings
              were performed during a Delayed Non-Match-to-Sample task that
              assessed working memory. Brain source analysis was carried out
              using sLORETA to estimate regional current source density
              differences between high and low (H-L) working memory loads.
              Academic achievement was measured by the Spanish version of the
              Woodcock-Johnson III test battery. The main results showed that

              related to better working memory performance ($\beta$=0.267, p =
              0.005). During retrieval, higher cardiorespiratory fitness was
              also associated with higher current density in temporal regions

              associated with higher current density in frontal regions
              ($\beta$=-0.261, p = 0.016). Our results suggest that
              cardiorespiratory fitness, but not speed-agility nor muscular
              fitness, is positively associated with brain current source
              density during working memory processes in children with
              overweight/obesity. Fitness-related current density differences
              in limbic regions were associated with better working memory.",

              training scenarios were also compared: user-independent (UI)
              training and user-dependent (UD) training. APPROACH: The CNN was
              trained in both UD and UI scenarios on two types of features for
              SSVEP classification: magnitude spectrum features (M-CNN) and
              complex spectrum features (C-CNN). The canonical correlation
              analysis (CCA), widely used in SSVEP processing, was used as the
              baseline. Additional comparisons were performed with task-related
              components analysis (TRCA) and filter-bank canonical correlation
              analysis (FBCCA). The performance of the proposed CNN pipelines,
              CCA, FBCCA and TRCA were evaluated with two datasets: a
              seven-class SSVEP dataset collected on 21 healthy participants
              and a twelve-class publicly available SSVEP dataset collected on
              ten healthy participants. MAIN RESULTS: The UD based training
              methods consistently outperformed the UI methods when all other
              conditions were the same, as one would expect. However, the
              proposed UI-C-CNN approach performed similarly to the UD-M-CNN
              across all cases investigated on both datasets. On Dataset 1, the
              average accuracies of the different methods for 1 s window length

              64.8\% $\pm$ 15.6\%, UI-M-CNN: 73.5\% $\pm$ 16.1\%, UI-C-CNN:
              81.6\% $\pm$ 12.3\%, UD-M-CNN: 87.8\% $\pm$ 7.6\% and UD-C-CNN:
              92.5\% $\pm$ 5\%. On Dataset 2, the average accuracies of the
              different methods for data length of 1 s were: UD-C-CNN: 92.33\%
              $\pm$ 11.1\%, UD-M-CNN: 82.77\% $\pm$ 16.7\%, UI-C-CNN: 81.6\%
              $\pm$ 18\%, UI-M-CNN: 70.5\% $\pm$ 22\%, FBCCA: 67.1\% $\pm$
              21\%, CCA: 62.7\% $\pm$ 21.5\%, TRCA: 40.4\% $\pm$ 14\%. Using
              t-SNE, visualizing the features extracted by the CNN pipelines
              further revealed that the C-CNN method likely learned both the
              amplitude and phase related information from the SSVEP data for
              classification, resulting in superior performance than the M-CNN
              methods. The results suggested that UI-C-CNN method proposed in
              this study offers a good balance between performance and cost of
              training data. SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed C-CNN based method is a
              suitable candidate for SSVEP-based BCIs and provides an improved
              performance in both UD and UI training scenarios.",

              Movement-related cortical potentials (MRCP), a type of slow
              cortical potentials, have been recently used for detection. In
              order to enhance the efficacy of closed-loop BCI systems based on

              from multi-channel scalp EEG was used to detect motor
              execution/imagination in healthy subjects and stroke patients.
              For MRCP detection, it was demonstrated that a new optimized
              spatial filtering technique led to better accuracy than a large
              Laplacian spatial filter and common spatial pattern. With the
              optimized spatial filter, the true positive rate (TPR) for
              detection of movement execution in healthy subjects (n = 15) was
              82.5 $\pm$ 7.8\%, with latency of -66.6 $\pm$ 121 ms. Although
              TPR decreased with motor imagination in healthy subject (n = 10,
              64.5 $\pm$ 5.33\%) and with attempted movements in stroke
              patients (n = 5, 55.01 $\pm$ 12.01\%), the results are promising
              for the application of this approach to provide patient-driven
              real-time neurofeedback.",

  abstract  = "INTRODUCTION: Behavioral studies suggest that deficits in
               cognitive domains and sensory-motor processes associated with
               Parkinson's disease (PD) impair the ability to walk in complex
               environments. However, the neural correlates of locomotion in
               complex environments are still unclear. METHODS: Twenty healthy
               older adults (mean age 69.7 $\pm$ 1.3 yrs) and 20 patients with
               PD (mean age 72.9 $\pm$ 1.6 yrs; disease duration: 6.8 $\pm$ 1.3
               yrs; UPDRSIII: 29.8 $\pm$ 2.4) were asked to imagine themselves
               walking while in the MRI scanner. Three imagined walking tasks,
               i.e., usual walking, obstacle negotiation, and navigation were
               performed. Watching the same virtual scenes without imagining
               walking served as control tasks. Whole brain analyses were used.
               RESULTS: Compared to usual walking, both groups had increased
               activation during obstacle negotiation in middle occipital gyrus
               (MOG) (pFWEcorr<0.001), middle frontal gyrus (MFG)
               (pFWEcorr<0.005), and cerebellum (pFWEcorr<0.001). Healthy older
               adults had higher activation in precuneus and MOG
               (pFWEcorr<0.023) during navigation, while no differences were
               observed in patients with PD. Between group comparisons revealed
               that patients with PD had a significantly higher activation in
               usual walking and obstacle negotiation (pFWEcorr<0.039) while
               during navigation task, healthy older adults had higher
               activation (pFWEcorr<0.047). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PD
               require greater activation during imagined usual walking and
               obstacle negotiation than healthy older adults. This increased
               activation may reflect a compensatory attempt to overcome
               inefficient neural activation in patients with PD. This
               increased activation may reduce the functional reserve needed
               during more demanding tasks such as during navigation which may
               contribute to the high prevalence of falls and dual tasking
               difficulties among patients with PD.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Despite the prevalence of dual-task (e.g., walking
               while talking) deficits in people with multiple sclerosis (MS),
               no neuroimaging studies to date have examined neuronal networks
               used for dual-task processing or specific brain areas related to
               dual-task performance in this population. A better understanding
               of the relationship among underlying brain areas and dual-task
               performance may improve targeted rehabilitation programs. The
               objective of this study was to examine relationships between
               neuroimaging measures and clinical measures of dual-task
               performance, and reported falls in persons with MS. MATERIALS
               AND METHODS: All participants completed measures of dual-task
               performance, a fall history, and neuroimaging on a 3 T MRI
               scanner. Spearman correlations were used to examine
               relationships among dual-task performance, falls and
               neuroimaging measures. RESULTS: Eighteen females with
               relapsing-remitting MS [mean age = 45.5 $\pm$ 8.2 SD; mean
               symptom duration = 12.3 $\pm$ 6.7 years; Expanded Disability

               study. Structural imaging measures of supplementary motor area
               (SMA) interhemispheric connectivity were significantly related
               to dual-task walking variability. CONCLUSIONS: The SMA
               interhemispheric tract may play a role in dual-task performance.
               Structural neuroimaging may be a useful adjunct to clinical
               measures to predict performance and provide information about
               recovery patterns in MS. Functional recovery can be challenging
               to objectively report in MS; diffusion tensor imaging could show
               microstructural improvements and suggest improved connectivity.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The electroencephalogram (EEG) can be a useful tool
              to investigate the neurophysiology of gait during walking. Our
              aims were to develop an approach that identify and quantify event
              related potentials (ERPs) during a gait cycle and to examine the
              effects of aging and dual tasking on these gait related
              potentials (GRPs). METHODS: 10 young and 10 older adults walked
              on a treadmill while wearing a wireless 20-channels EEG and
              accelerometers on the ankles. Each heel strike extracted from the
              accelerometers was used as an event to which the electrical brain
              activity pattern was locked. The subjects performed usual and
              dual task walking that included an auditory oddball task. GRPs
              amplitude and latency were computed, and a new measure referred
              to as Amplitude Pattern Consistency (APC) was developed to
              quantify the consistency of these GRP amplitudes within a gait
              cycle. The results were compared between and within groups using
              linear mixed model analysis. RESULTS: The electrical pattern
              during a gait cycle consisted of two main positive GRPs.
              Differences in these GRPs between young and older adults were
              observed in Pz and Cz. In Pz, older adults had higher GRPs
              amplitude (p = 0.006, p = 0.010), and in Cz lower APC (p =
              0.025). Alterations were also observed between the walking tasks.
              Both groups showed shorter latency during oddball walking
              compared to usual walking in Cz (p = 0.040). In addition, the APC
              in Cz was correlated with gait speed (r = 0.599, p = 0.011) in
              all subjects and with stride time variability in the older adults
              (r = -0.703, p = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to
              define specific gait related potentials within a gait cycle using
              novel methods for quantifying waveforms. Our findings show the
              potential of this approach to be applied broadly to study the EEG
              during gait in a variety of contexts. The observed changes in
              GRPs with aging and walking task and the relationship between
              GRPs and gait may suggest the neurophysiologic foundation for
              studying walking and for developing new approaches for improving
              gait.",

               simultaneously execute both cognitive and motor tasks. The
               ability to perform such tasks is commonly assessed using a
               dual-task paradigm that has the capacity to manipulate both
               cognitive and motor components of an action. Dual-task
               performance provides an opportunity to obtain an insight into
               how cognitive and motor function are affected during natural
               tasks (e.g., locomotion). The following study aimed to determine
               the effectiveness of using a goal-directed multidirectional
               locomotor task to measure differences in task-related (tasks of
               increasing difficulty) electro-cortical activity. In the
               single-task condition participants walked around a grid-based
               track, performing directional changes at each intersection in
               response to a sensory stimulus. In the dual-task condition
               participants performed the same primary task while performing a
               simultaneous memory recall task. Behavioural differences in
               trial completion time and electro-cortical activity were
               identified in relation to the posterior N2 and P3 component mean

               higher-level cognitive task during walking (dual-task),
               interference arises in a shared system that influences neural
               mechanisms involved in attention and selection for action, and
               later cognitive processes recruited in working memory and
               cognitive control. This study extends previous work and shows
               that performing a more complex cognitive task while walking,
               elicits interference effects sensitive to higher-level cognitive
               processes, and takes the next step towards measurement of
               electro-cortical activity within naturalistic environments.",

  abstract = "Examining the processing of others' body-related information in
              the perceivers' brain across the neurotypical and clinical
              population is a key topic in the domain of cognitive
              neurosciences. We argue that beyond classical neuroimaging
              techniques and frequency analyses, methods that can be easily
              adapted to capture the fast processing of body-related
              information in the brain are needed. Here we introduce a novel
              method that allows this by measuring event-related potentials
              recorded with electroencephalography (ERPs-EEG). This method
              possesses known EEG advantages (low cost, high temporal
              resolution, established paradigms) plus an improvement of its
              main limitation; i.e., spatiotemporally smoothed resolution due
              to mixed neural sources. This occurs when participants are
              presented and process images of bodies/actions that recruit
              posterior visual cortices. Such stimulus-evoked activity may
              spread and mask the recording of simultaneous activity arising
              from sensorimotor brain areas, which also process body-related
              information. Therefore, it is difficult to dissociate the
              contributing role of different brain regions. To overcome this,
              we propose eliciting a combination of somatosensory, motor, and
              visual-evoked potentials during processing of body-related
              information (vs non-body-related). Next, brain activity from
              sensorimotor and visual systems can be dissociated by subtracting
              activity from trials containing only visual-evoked potentials to
              those trials containing either a mixture of visual and
              somatosensory or visual and motor-cortical potentials. This
              allows isolating visually driven neural activity in areas other
              than visual. To introduce this method, we revise recent work
              using this method, consider the processing of body-related
              stimuli in the brain, as well as outline key methodological
              aspects to-be-considered. This work provides a clear guideline to
              researchers interested or transitioning from behavioural to ERPs
              studies, offering the possibility to adapt well-established
              paradigms in the EEG realm to study others' body-related

              functional limitations of older adults. Despite sizable interest
              in determining how age alters walking mechanics, small sample
              sizes and varied outcome measures have precluded a comprehensive
              understanding of the impact of age on lower extremity joint
              kinematics and kinetics. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to
              perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the aging gait
              mechanics literature. METHODS: The overall standardized effect of
              age on walking mechanics was computed for 29 studies (200
              standardized effects). To account for variation in reported
              outcome variables, analyses were carried out for comparisons
              between young and older adult results using all discrete
              kinematic or kinetic variables reported for the ankle, knee, or
              hip. Different variables reported for a given joint were then
              analyzed as separate categorical moderators. RESULTS: The overall
              standardized effect of age was large for ground reaction forces,
              moderate for ankle and small for knee and hip kinematics and
              ankle and hip kinetics. When the analysis was restricted to
              studies with similar or matched walking speed, the standardized
              effects of age remained similar except for hip power generation
              and knee kinematic variables. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this
              meta-analysis provide evidence to support moderate standardized
              effects, with and without consideration of walking speeds, for
              changes in lower extremity kinematics, joint moments and powers
              at the ankle, and ground reaction forces. The standardized

  abstract    = "During childhood and adolescence, the human brain undergoes
                 various micro- and macroscopic changes. Understanding the
                 neurophysiological changes within this reorganizational
                 process is crucial, as many major psychiatric disorders emerge
                 during this critical phase of life. In electroencephalography
                 (EEG), a widely studied signal component are alpha
                 oscillations (~8-13 Hz), which have been linked to
                 developmental changes throughout the lifespan. Previous
                 neurophysiological studies have demonstrated an increase of
                 the alpha peak frequency and a decrease of alpha power to be
                 related to brain maturation. The latter results have been
                 questioned by recent developments in EEG signal processing
                 techniques, as it could be demonstrated that aperiodic
                 (non-oscillatory) components in the EEG signal conflate
                 findings on periodic (oscillatory) changes, and thus need to
                 be decomposed accordingly. We therefore analyzed a large,
                 openly available pediatric dataset of 1485 children and
                 adolescents in the age range of 5 to 21 years, in order to
                 clarify the role of alpha oscillations and aperiodic signal
                 components in this period of life. We first replicated
                 previous findings of an increase of alpha peak frequency with
                 age. Our results further suggest that alpha oscillatory power
                 decreases with increasing age, however, when controlling for
                 the aperiodic signal component, this effect inverted such as
                 the aperiodic adjusted alpha power parameters significantly
                 increase with advanced brain maturation, while the aperiodic
                 signal component flattens and its offset decreases. Thus,
                 interpretations of these oscillatory changes should be done
                 with caution and incorporate changes in the aperiodic signal.
                 These findings highlight the importance of taking aperiodic
                 signal components into account when investigating age related

              are needed to re-learn walking with a prosthesis. The long
              adaptation process that consolidates a novel gait pattern seems
              to depend on cerebellar function for reinforcement of specific
              gait modifications, but the precise, step-by-step gait
              modifications (e.g., foot placement) most likely rely on top-down
              commands from the brainstem and cerebral cortex. The aim of this
              study was to identify, in able-bodied individuals, the specific
              modulations of cortical rhythms that accompany short-term gait
              modifications during first-time use of a dummy prosthesis.
              METHODS: Fourteen na{\"\i}ve participants walked on a treadmill
              without (one block, 4 min) and with a dummy prosthesis (three
              blocks, 3 $\times$ 4 min), while ground reaction forces and
              32-channel EEG were recorded. Gait cycle duration, stance phase
              duration, step width, maximal ground reaction force and, ground
              reaction force trace over time were measured to identify gait
              modifications. Independent component analysis of EEG data
              isolated brain-related activity from distinct anatomical sources.
              The source-level data were segmented into gait cycles and
              analyzed in the time-frequency domain to reveal relative
              enhancement or suppression of intrinsic cortical oscillations.
              Differences between walking conditions were evaluated with
              one-way ANOVA and post-hoc testing ($\alpha$ = 0.05). RESULTS:
              Immediate modifications occurred in the gait parameters when
              participants were introduced to the dummy prosthesis. Except for
              gait cycle duration, these modifications remained throughout the
              duration of the experimental session. Power modulations of the
              theta, mu, beta, and gamma rhythms, of sources presumably from
              the fronto-central and the parietal cortices, were found across
              the experimental session. Significant power modulations of the
              theta, beta, and gamma rhythms within the gait cycle were
              predominately found around the heel strike of both feet and the
              swing phase of the right (prosthetic) leg. CONCLUSIONS: The
              modulations of cortical activity could be related to whole-body
              coordination, including the swing phase and placing of the
              prosthesis, and the bodyweight transfer between legs and arms.
              Reduced power modulation of the gamma rhythm within the
              experimental session may indicate initial motor memories being
              formed. Better understanding of the sensorimotor processes behind
              gait modifications may inform the development of neurofeedback
              strategies to assist gait rehabilitation.",

               walking speed. At typical speeds, arm and leg movements,
               respectively, are frequency locked in a 1:1 ratio but at slow
               speeds this changes to a 2:1 ratio. It is unknown if the changes
               in interlimb ratio that accompany slow walking speeds alters
               regulation of somatosensory feedback. To probe the neural
               interactions between the arms and legs, somatosensory linkages
               in the form of interlimb cutaneous reflexes were examined. It
               was hypothesized that different interlimb frequencies and
               walking speeds would result in changes in the modulation of
               cutaneous reflexes between the arms and legs. To test this
               hypothesis, participants walked in four combinations of walking
               speed (typical, slow) and interlimb coordination (1:1, and 2:1),

               evaluated with stimulation applied to the superficial peroneal
               nerve at the ankle and superficial radial nerve at the wrist.
               Results show main effects of interlimb coordination and walking
               speed on cutaneous reflex modulation, effects are largest in the
               swing phase, and a directional coupling was observed, where
               changes in the frequency of arm movements had a greater effect
               on muscle activity in the legs compared to the reverse.
               Task-dependent modulation was also revealed from stimulation at
               local and remote sources. Understanding the underlying neural
               mechanisms for the organization of rhythmic arm movement, and
               its coordination with the legs in healthy participants, can give
               insight into pathological walking, and will facilitate the

               interlimb neural interaction mechanisms and their nature are yet
               to be fully elucidated. The purpose of this study was to
               investigate effects of motor preparation and execution of
               ipsilateral, contralateral, and bilateral upper limb muscle
               contractions on the excitability of corticospinal and spinal
               reflex circuits of the lower limb muscles. Fourteen able-bodied
               individuals were recruited in each study. Experiments were
               conducted to investigate 1) corticospinal excitability with
               transcranial magnetic stimulation applied on the primary motor
               cortex to evoke motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and 2) spinal
               reflex excitability with transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation
               applied at the lumbothoracic level to evoke spinal reflexes.
               Measurements were recorded from multiple right lower limb
               muscles simultaneously during 1) ipsilateral (right), 2)
               contralateral (left), and 3) bilateral (right and left) elbow
               flexion. The results indicate that MEPs in lower limb muscles
               were facilitated during both preparation and execution of elbow
               flexion, whereas spinal reflexes were facilitated only during
               motor execution. Moreover, the extent of facilitation did not
               differ between right, left, and bilateral contractions. In
               conclusion, motor preparation for upper limb muscle contractions
               did not affect spinal circuits but seemed to affect the
               supraspinal networks controlling lower limb muscles. However,
               actual contraction (motor execution) of upper limb muscles is
               required to facilitate spinal reflex circuits controlling the
               lower limb muscles. Moreover, interlimb remote facilitation in
               corticospinal and spinal reflex circuits did not depend on
               whether contralateral or ipsilateral hands were contracted or if
               they were contracted bilaterally.NEW \& NOTEWORTHY We found that
               upper limb muscle contractions facilitated corticospinal
               circuits controlling lower limb muscles even during motor
               preparation, whereas motor execution of the task was required to
               facilitate spinal circuits. We also found that facilitation did
               not depend on whether contralateral or ipsilateral hands were
               contracted or if they were contracted bilaterally. Overall,
               these findings suggest that training of unaffected upper limbs

               deficits in stroke patients, as well as possibly improvement of
               motor function in Parkinson's disease; yet, the mechanism of
               action is unclear. Since Parkinson's and other neuropsychiatric

               rhythms, we investigated whether noisy galvanic vestibular
               stimulation was associated with measurable changes in EEG
               oscillatory rhythms within theta (4--7.5 Hz), low alpha (8--10
               Hz), high alpha (10.5--12 Hz), beta (13--30 Hz) and gamma
               (31--50 Hz) bands. We recorded the EEG while simultaneously
               delivering noisy bilateral, bipolar stimulation at varying
               intensities of imperceptible currents -- at 10, 26, 42, 58, 74
               and 90\% of sensory threshold -- to ten neurologically healthy
               subjects. Using standard spectral analysis, we investigated the
               transient aftereffects of noisy stimulation on rhythms.
               Subsequently, using robust artifact rejection techniques and the
               Least Absolute Shrinkage Selection Operator regression and
               cross-validation, we assessed the combinations of channels and
               power spectral features within each EEG frequency band that were
               linearly related with stimulus intensity. We show that noisy
               galvanic vestibular stimulation predominantly leads to a mild
               suppression of gamma power in lateral regions immediately after
               stimulation, followed by delayed increase in beta and gamma
               power in frontal regions approximately 20--25 s after
               stimulation ceased. Ongoing changes in the power of each
               oscillatory band throughout frontal, central/parietal, occipital
               and bilateral electrodes predicted the intensity of galvanic
               vestibular stimulation in a stimulus-dependent manner,
               demonstrating linear effects of stimulation on brain rhythms. We
               propose that modulation of neural oscillations is a potential
               mechanism for the previously-described cognitive and motor
               effects of vestibular stimulation, and noisy galvanic vestibular
               stimulation may provide an additional non-invasive means for

  abstract = "Walking function, which is critical to performing many activities
              of daily living, is commonly assessed by walking speed. Walking
              speed is dependent on propulsion, which is governed by ankle
              moment and the posture of the trailing limb during push-off.
              Here, we present a new gait training paradigm that utilizes a
              dual belt treadmill to train both components of propulsion by
              accelerating the belt of the trailing limb during push-off.
              Accelerations require participants to produce greater propulsive
              force to counteract inertial effects, and increases extension of
              the trailing limb through increased belt velocity. We
              hypothesized that one session of training in our paradigm would
              produce after effects in propulsion mechanics and, consequently,

              (LA)--and compared their results to a third control group (VC)
              that walked at a higher velocity during training. Results show
              that the HA group significantly increased walking speed following
              training (mean $\pm$ s.e.m: 0.073 $\pm$ 0.013 m/s, p < 0.001).
              The change in walking speed in the LA and VC groups was not
              significant (LA: 0.032 $\pm$ 0.013 m/s, VC: -0.003 $\pm$ 0.013
              m/s). Responder analysis showed that changes in push-off posture
              and in activation of ankle plantar-flexor muscles contributed to
              the greater increases in gait speed measured in the HA group
              compared to the LA and VC groups. The duration of after effects
              post training suggest that the measured changes in neuromotor
              coordination are consistent with use-dependent learning.",

              performance: a review and analysis",
  author   = "Klimesch, W",
  abstract = "Evidence is presented that EEG oscillations in the alpha and
              theta band reflect cognitive and memory performance in
              particular. Good performance is related to two types of EEG
              phenomena (i) a tonic increase in alpha but a decrease in theta
              power, and (ii) a large phasic (event-related) decrease in alpha
              but increase in theta, depending on the type of memory demands.
              Because alpha frequency shows large interindividual differences
              which are related to age and memory performance, this double
              dissociation between alpha vs. theta and tonic vs. phasic changes
              can be observed only if fixed frequency bands are abandoned. It
              is suggested to adjust the frequency windows of alpha and theta
              for each subject by using individual alpha frequency as an anchor
              point. Based on this procedure, a consistent interpretation of a
              variety of findings is made possible. As an example, in a similar
              way as brain volume does, upper alpha power increases (but theta
              power decreases) from early childhood to adulthood, whereas the
              opposite holds true for the late part of the lifespan. Alpha
              power is lowered and theta power enhanced in subjects with a
              variety of different neurological disorders. Furthermore, after
              sustained wakefulness and during the transition from waking to
              sleeping when the ability to respond to external stimuli ceases,
              upper alpha power decreases, whereas theta increases.
              Event-related changes indicate that the extent of upper alpha
              desynchronization is positively correlated with (semantic)
              long-term memory performance, whereas theta synchronization is
              positively correlated with the ability to encode new information.
              The reviewed findings are interpreted on the basis of brain
              oscillations. It is suggested that the encoding of new
              information is reflected by theta oscillations in
              hippocampo-cortical feedback loops, whereas search and retrieval
              processes in (semantic) long-term memory are reflected by upper
              alpha oscillations in thalamo-cortical feedback loops.",

              approaches allow for recordings in both stationary and mobile
              settings. Irrespective of the experimental setting, EEG
              recordings are contaminated with noise that has to be removed
              before the data can be functionally interpreted. Independent
              component analysis (ICA) is a commonly used tool to remove
              artifacts such as eye movement, muscle activity, and external
              noise from the data and to analyze activity on the level of EEG
              effective brain sources. The effectiveness of filtering the data
              is one key preprocessing step to improve the decomposition that
              has been investigated previously. However, no study thus far
              compared the different requirements of mobile and stationary
              experiments regarding the preprocessing for ICA decomposition. We
              thus evaluated how movement in EEG experiments, the number of
              channels, and the high-pass filter cutoff during preprocessing
              influence the ICA decomposition. We found that for commonly used
              settings (stationary experiment, 64 channels, 0.5 Hz filter), the
              ICA results are acceptable. However, high-pass filters of up to 2
              Hz cut-off frequency should be used in mobile experiments, and
              more channels require a higher filter to reach an optimal
              decomposition. Fewer brain ICs were found in mobile experiments,
              but cleaning the data with ICA has been proved to be important
              and functional even with low-density channel setups. Based on the

               subject is physically guided through an ideal motion by an
               haptic interface. It is especially valuable for repetitive
               training, and more effective when coupled with additional
               sensory feedback, e.g. the visual modality. The advantage of
               additional feedback modalities may stem from the learner's
               increased active participation and engagement. Here, we test
               this hypothesis by analyzing the learners' brain state during
               haptic training. Specifically, we focus on the sensorimotor
               rhythms (SMR), since they have been previously associated with
               the level of engagement directed towards a motor task. We
               conducted a circle-drawing haptic training, where subjects were
               asked to memorise the guided trajectory while their
               electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. During the experiment,
               only the haptic modality was maintained (i.e. unimodal) by
               keeping the task workspace visually hidden. Results show a clear
               trend: subjects who exhibited a performance improvement, were
               characterized by a stronger desynchronization of the beta
               rhythms over the contralateral hemisphere. This is in agreement
               with recent studies showing that contralateral beta rhythms
               changes are associated with motor skills retention. Moreover,
               under the assumption that SMR are indeed a marker of engagement,
               our results represent accumulating evidence that active
               participation is crucial for haptic training.",

               reanalyzed data from 14 patients with cerebellar degeneration
               using voxel-based morphometry. We found that adjacent regions
               with only little overlap in the anterior arm area (lobules IV to
               VI) are important for adaptation in both tasks. Although

               were recorded from 12 healthy human subjects (21-32 years of
               age) before perturbing their balance with backward translations

               without a visual cue that warned them 2s before the perturbation
               (the Cue and No Cue conditions, respectively). RESULTS:
               Contingent negative variation (CNV) was evident before
               perturbation onset in only the Cue condition. In the Cue
               condition, the subjects also produced smaller center of pressure

               characterized by motor reactions involving different patterns of
               activity, depending on postural task conditions. It remains
               unknown whether well-documented cortical responses to
               instability share common spatio-temporal characteristics,
               despite variations in the sensory, motor, and postural
               components of the reactions. The objective was to explore the
               spatio-temporal profile of cortical potentials evoked by
               instability requiring either upper- or lower-limb compensatory
               responses. The hypothesis that upper- and lower-limb
               balance-correcting reactions are associated with evoked cortical
               potentials (N1, P2) featuring similar spatio-temporal
               characteristics was tested by inducing postural perturbations in
               seated (SIT) or standing (STAND) positions. For both conditions,
               N1 amplitude was greatest at FCz, with no significant
               differences in the timing of N1 peak (SIT: 142.4+/-7.95ms;
               STAND: 148.4+/-4.10ms) or N1 amplitude (SIT: 37.16+/-6.99microV;
               STAND: 39.08+/-4.51microV). The amplitude of the P2 potential
               (measured at CPz) was significantly larger in the STAND

               STAND: 322.7+/-7.61ms). Though differences in the amplitude of
               components of evoked potentials may reflect the extent of
               cortical involvement in different aspects of postural control,
               similarities in the spatio-temporal components of cortical
               potentials between tasks reflects generalizable cortical

               types of ERPs with respect to their frequency components? In
               this study auditory EPs were elicited by 1500 Hz tones. The
               first type of ERPs was responses to 3rd attended tones in an
               omitted stimulus paradigm where every 4th stimulus was omitted.
               The second type of ERPs was responses to rare 1600 Hz tones in
               an oddball paradigm. The amplitudes of delta and theta
               components of EPs and ERPs showed significant differences: in
               responses to 3rd attended tones there was a significant increase
               in the theta frequency band (frontal and parietal locations;
               0-250 ms). In the delta frequency band there was no significant

               responses and an additional prolongation of theta oscillations
               was observed (late theta response: 250-500 ms). These results

              counterbalanced to prevent any influence of systematic order on
              the dependent variables. Oscillatory potentials at the Cz

              quantified signal fidelity using signal-to-noise ratio (SNR);
              signal-to-motion ratio (SMR); and a metric we previously

              EMG signal quality requires both good signal-to-noise ratio and
              good signal-to-motion ratio. Wear patterns over the eight days

              signal-to-noise ratios, signal-to-motion ratios, and Signal

              long-term EMG recording during limited dynamic lower limb

               This approach, termed Mobile Brain/Body Imaging (MoBI), has the

               study was to evaluate the test-retest reliability of cognitive
               ERPs recorded while walking. High-density EEG was acquired from
               12 young adults on two occasions, separated by an average of
               2.3years, as they performed a Go/No-Go response inhibition
               paradigm. During each testing session, participants performed
               the task while walking on a treadmill and seated. Using the
               intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) as a measure of
               agreement, we focused on two well-established neurophysiological
               correlates of cognitive control, the N2 and P3 ERPs. Following
               ICA-based artifact rejection, the earlier N2 yielded good to
               excellent levels of reliability for both amplitude and latency,
               while measurements for the later P3 component were generally
               less robust but still indicative of adequate to good levels of
               stability. Interestingly, the N2 was more consistent between
               walking sessions, compared to sitting, for both hits and correct
               rejection trials. In contrast, the P3 waveform tended to have a
               higher degree of consistency during sitting conditions. Overall,
               these results suggest that the electro-cortical signals obtained

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: When an unexpected perturbation in the environment
               occurs, the subsequent alertness state may cause a brain
               activation responding to that perturbation which can be detected
               and employed by a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). In this work,
               the possibility of detecting a sudden obstacle appearance
               analyzing electroencephalographic (EEG) signals is assessed. For
               this purpose, different features of EEG signals are evaluated
               during the appearance of sudden obstacles while a subject is
               walking on a treadmill. The future goal is to use this procedure
               to detect any obstacle appearance during walking when the user
               is wearing a lower limb exoskeleton in order to generate an
               emergency stop command for the exoskeleton. This would enhance
               the user-exoskeleton interaction, improving the safety
               mechanisms of current exoskeletons. METHODS: In order to detect
               the change in the brain activity when an obstacle suddenly
               appears, different features of EEG signals are evaluated using
               the recordings of five healthy subjects. Since the change in the
               brain activity occurs in the time domain, the features evaluated
               are: common spatial patterns, average power, slope, and the
               coefficients of a polynomial fit. A Linear Discriminant
               Analysis-based classifier is used to differentiate between two
               conditions: the appearance or not of an obstacle. The evaluation
               of the performance to detect the obstacles is made in terms of
               accuracy, true positive (TP) and false positive (FP) rates.
               RESULTS: From the offline analysis, the best performance is
               achieved when the slope or the polynomial coefficients are used
               as features, with average detection accuracy rates of 74.0 and
               79.5 \%, respectively. These results are consistent with the
               pseudo-online results, where a complete EEG recording is
               segmented into windows of 500 ms and overlapped 400 ms, and a
               decision about the obstacle appearance is made for each window.
               The results of the best subject were 11 out of 14 obstacles
               detected with a rate of 9.09 FPs/min, and 10 out of 14 obstacles
               detected with a rate of 6.34 FPs/min using slope and polynomial
               coefficients features, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: An EEG-based
               BCI can be developed to detect the appearance of unexpected
               obstacles. The average accuracy achieved is 79.5 \% of success
               rate with a low number of false detections. Thus, the online
               performance of the BCI would be suitable for commanding in a
               safely way a lower limb exoskeleton during walking.",

                   loss of connectivity between a surface and an electrode.
                   Electroencephalography (EEG) uses a dense array of
                   electrodes, hence ``popped'' segments are among the most
                   pervasive type of artifact seen during the collection of EEG
                   data. In many cases, the continuity of EEG data is critical
                   for downstream applications (e.g. brain machine interface)
                   and requires that popped segments be accurately
                   interpolated. In this paper we frame the interpolation
                   problem as a self-learning task using a deep encoder-decoder
                   network. We compare our approach against contemporary
                   interpolation methods on a publicly available EEG data set.
                   Our approach exhibited a minimum of ~15\% improvement over
                   contemporary approaches when tested on subjects and tasks
                   not used during model training. We demonstrate how our
                   model's performance can be enhanced further on novel
                   subjects and tasks using transfer learning. All code and

  author   = "Tresch, Matthew C and Cheung, Vincent C K and d'Avella, Andrea",
  abstract = "Several recent studies have used matrix factorization algorithms
              to assess the hypothesis that behaviors might be produced through
              the combination of a small number of muscle synergies. Although
              generally agreeing in their basic conclusions, these studies have
              used a range of different algorithms, making their interpretation
              and integration difficult. We therefore compared the performance
              of these different algorithms on both simulated and experimental
              data sets. We focused on the ability of these algorithms to
              identify the set of synergies underlying a data set. All data
              sets consisted of nonnegative values, reflecting the nonnegative
              data of muscle activation patterns. We found that the performance
              of principal component analysis (PCA) was generally lower than
              that of the other algorithms in identifying muscle synergies.
              Factor analysis (FA) with varimax rotation was better than PCA,
              and was generally at the same levels as independent component
              analysis (ICA) and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). ICA
              performed very well on data sets corrupted by constant variance
              Gaussian noise, but was impaired on data sets with
              signal-dependent noise and when synergy activation coefficients
              were correlated. Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) performed
              similarly to ICA and FA on data sets with signal-dependent noise
              and was generally robust across data sets. The best algorithms
              were ICA applied to the subspace defined by PCA (ICAPCA) and a
              version of probabilistic ICA with nonnegativity constraints
              (pICA). We also evaluated some commonly used criteria to identify
              the number of synergies underlying a data set, finding that only
              likelihood ratios based on factor analysis identified the correct
              number of synergies for data sets with signal-dependent noise in
              some cases. We then proposed an ad hoc procedure, finding that it
              was able to identify the correct number in a larger number of
              cases. Finally, we applied these methods to an experimentally
              obtained data set. The best performing algorithms (FA, ICA, NMF,
              ICAPCA, pICA) identified synergies very similar to one another.
              Based on these results, we discuss guidelines for using
              factorization algorithms to analyze muscle activation patterns.
              More generally, the ability of several algorithms to identify the
              correct muscle synergies and activation coefficients in simulated
              data, combined with their consistency when applied to
              physiological data sets, suggests that the muscle synergies found
              by a particular algorithm are not an artifact of that algorithm,
              but reflect basic aspects of the organization of muscle
              activation patterns underlying behaviors.",

              performance of complex movements is associated with neural
              plasticity. However, it is unknown whether even simple movements,
              repeated over a short period of time, are effective in inducing
              cortical representational changes. Whether the motor cortex can
              retain specific kinematic aspects of a recently practiced
              movement is also unknown. We used focal transcranial magnetic
              stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex to evoke isolated and
              directionally consistent thumb movements. Thumb movements then
              were practiced in a different direction. Subsequently, TMS came
              to evoke movements in or near the recently practiced direction
              for several minutes before returning to the original direction.
              To initiate a change of the TMS-evoked movement direction, 15 or
              30 min of continuous training were required in most of the
              subjects and, on two occasions, as little as 5 or 10 min.

              corticofugal axons with transcranial electrical stimulation,
              pointing to cortex as the site of plasticity. These findings
              suggest that the training rapidly, and transiently, established a
              change in the cortical network representing the thumb, which
              encoded kinematic details of the practiced movement. This
              phenomenon may be regarded as a short-term memory for movement
              and be the first step of skill acquisition.",

  abstract = "Visuomotor adaptation has been thought to be an implicit process
              that results when a sensory-prediction error signal is used to
              update a forward model. A striking feature of human competence is
              the ability to receive verbal instructions and employ strategies
              to solve tasks; such explicit processes could be used during
              visuomotor adaptation. Here, we used a novel task design that
              allowed us to obtain continuous verbal reports of aiming
              direction while participants learned a visuomotor rotation. We
              had two main hypotheses: the contribution of explicit learning
              would be modulated by instruction and the contribution of
              implicit learning would be modulated by the form of error
              feedback. By directly assaying aiming direction, we could
              identify the time course of the explicit component and, via
              subtraction, isolate the implicit component of learning. There
              were marked differences in the time courses of explicit and
              implicit contributions to learning. Explicit learning, driven by
              target error, was achieved by initially large then smaller
              explorations of aiming direction biased toward the correct
              solution. In contrast, implicit learning, driven by a
              sensory-prediction error, was slow and monotonic. Continuous
              error feedback reduced the amplitude of explicit learning and
              increased the contribution of implicit learning. The presence of
              instruction slightly increased the rate of initial learning and
              only had a subtle effect on implicit learning. We conclude that
              visuomotor adaptation, even in the absence of instruction,
              results from the interplay between explicit learning driven by
              target error and implicit learning of a forward model driven by
              prediction error.",

              if changes in the perceptual domain would demonstrate

              practice) and if these changes would parallel the savings

              developed with different magnitudes and over different
              timescales, leading us to conclude that motor and perceptual

              Electroencephalography (M/EEG) is central to applications like
              decoding, brain-computer-interfaces (BCI) or biomarker
              development and is facilitated by supervised machine learning.
              Yet most of the literature is concerned with classification of
              outcomes defined at the event-level. Here, we focus on predicting
              continuous outcomes from M/EEG signal defined at the
              subject-level, and analyze about 600 MEG recordings from Cam-CAN
              dataset and about 1000 EEG recordings from TUH dataset.
              Considering different generative mechanisms for M/EEG signals and
              the biomedical outcome, we propose statistically-consistent
              predictive models that avoid source-reconstruction based on the
              covariance as representation. Our mathematical analysis and
              ground truth simulations demonstrated that consistent function
              approximation can be obtained with supervised spatial filtering
              or by embedding with Riemannian geometry. Additional simulations
              revealed that Riemannian methods were more robust to model
              violations, in particular geometric distortions induced by
              individual anatomy. To estimate the relative contribution of
              brain dynamics and anatomy to prediction performance, we propose
              a novel model inspection procedure based on biophysical forward
              modeling. Applied to prediction of outcomes at the subject-level,
              the analysis revealed that the Riemannian model better exploited
              anatomical information while sensitivity to brain dynamics was
              similar across methods. We then probed the robustness of the
              models across different data cleaning options. Environmental
              denoising was globally important but Riemannian models were
              strikingly robust and continued performing well even without
              preprocessing. Our results suggest each method has its niche:
              supervised spatial filtering is practical for event-level
              prediction while the Riemannian model may enable simple
              end-to-end learning.",

              sensory-cognitive processing demands during naturalistic

              reduced attention to target stimuli during motion. ERP data

  author   = "Shadmehr, R and Mussa-Ivaldi, F A",
  abstract = "We investigated how the CNS learns to control movements in
              different dynamical conditions, and how this learned behavior is
              represented. In particular, we considered the task of making
              reaching movements in the presence of externally imposed forces
              from a mechanical environment. This environment was a force field
              produced by a robot manipulandum, and the subjects made reaching
              movements while holding the end-effector of this manipulandum.
              Since the force field significantly changed the dynamics of the
              task, subjects' initial movements in the force field were grossly
              distorted compared to their movements in free space. However,
              with practice, hand trajectories in the force field converged to
              a path very similar to that observed in free space. This
              indicated that for reaching movements, there was a kinematic plan
              independent of dynamical conditions. The recovery of performance
              within the changed mechanical environment is motor adaptation. In
              order to investigate the mechanism underlying this adaptation, we
              considered the response to the sudden removal of the field after
              a training phase. The resulting trajectories, named aftereffects,
              were approximately mirror images of those that were observed when
              the subjects were initially exposed to the field. This suggested
              that the motor controller was gradually composing a model of the
              force field, a model that the nervous system used to predict and
              compensate for the forces imposed by the environment. In order to
              explore the structure of the model, we investigated whether
              adaptation to a force field, as presented in a small region, led
              to aftereffects in other regions of the workspace. We found that
              indeed there were aftereffects in workspace regions where no
              exposure to the field had taken place; that is, there was
              transfer beyond the boundary of the training data. This
              observation rules out the hypothesis that the subject's model of
              the force field was constructed as a narrow association between
              visited states and experienced forces; that is, adaptation was
              not via composition of a look-up table. In contrast, subjects
              modeled the force field by a combination of computational
              elements whose output was broadly tuned across the motor state
              space. These elements formed a model that extrapolated to outside
              the training region in a coordinate system similar to that of the
              joints and muscles rather than end-point forces. This geometric
              property suggests that the elements of the adaptive process
              represent dynamics of a motor task in terms of the intrinsic
              coordinate system of the sensors and actuators.",

              were measured using simultaneous EEG. Pre-stimulus FC was

              mutual information, weighted phase lag index, coherence and phase

              full range (15-400 ms) of the TEP at the sensor and source level.
              However, the predictive value of all FC measures is quite
              limited, accounting for less than 10\% of the variance of TEP

  abstract = "To what extent electrocorticography (ECoG) and
              electroencephalography (scalp EEG) differ in their capability to
              locate sources of deep brain activity is far from evident.
              Compared to EEG, the spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio
              of ECoG is superior but its spatial coverage is more restricted,
              as is arguably the volume of tissue activity effectively measured
              from. Moreover, scalp EEG studies are providing evidence of
              locating activity from deep sources such as the hippocampus using
              high-density setups during quiet wakefulness. To address this
              question, we recorded a multimodal dataset from 4 patients with
              refractory epilepsy during quiet wakefulness. This data comprises
              simultaneous scalp, subdural and depth EEG electrode recordings.
              The latter was located in the hippocampus or insula and provided
              us with our ``ground truth'' for source localization of deep
              activity. We applied independent component analysis (ICA) for the
              purpose of separating the independent sources in theta, alpha and
              beta frequency band activity. In all patients subdural- and scalp
              EEG components were observed which had a significant zero-lag
              correlation with one or more contacts of the depth electrodes.
              Subsequent dipole modeling of the correlating components revealed
              dipole locations that were significantly closer to the depth
              electrodes compared to the dipole location of non-correlating
              components. These findings support the idea that components found
              in both recording modalities originate from neural activity in
              close proximity to the depth electrodes. Sources localized with
              subdural electrodes were ~70\% closer to the depth electrode than
              sources localized with EEG with an absolute improvement of around
              ~2cm. In our opinion, this is not a considerable improvement in
              source localization accuracy given that, for clinical purposes,
              ECoG electrodes were implanted in close proximity to the depth
              electrodes. Furthermore, the ECoG grid attenuates the scalp EEG,
              due to the electrically isolating silastic sheets in which the
              ECoG electrodes are embedded. Our results on dipole modeling show
              that the deep source localization accuracy of scalp EEG is
              comparable to that of ECoG. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Deep and
              subcortical regions play an important role in brain function.
              However, as joint recordings at multiple spatial scales to study
              brain function in humans are still scarce, it is still unresolved
              to what extent ECoG and EEG differ in their capability to locate
              sources of deep brain activity. To the best of our knowledge,
              this is the first study presenting a dataset of simultaneously
              recorded EEG, ECoG and depth electrodes in the hippocampus or
              insula, with a focus on non-epileptiform activity (quiet
              wakefulness). Furthermore, we are the first study to provide
              experimental findings on the comparison of source localization of
              deep cortical structures between invasive and non-invasive brain
              activity measured from the cortical surface.",

  abstract = "The goal of this study was to determine whether the cortical
              responses elicited by whole-body balance perturbations were
              similar to established cortical markers of action monitoring.
              Postural changes imposed by balance perturbations elicit a robust
              negative potential (N1) and a brisk increase of theta activity in
              the electroencephalogram recorded over midfrontal scalp areas.
              Because action monitoring is a cognitive function proposed to
              detect errors and initiate corrective adjustments, we
              hypothesized that the possible cortical markers of action
              monitoring during balance control (N1 potential and theta rhythm)
              scale with perturbation intensity and the eventual execution of
              reactive stepping responses (as opposed to feet-in-place
              responses). We recorded high-density electroencephalogram from
              eleven young individuals, who participated in an experimental
              balance assessment. The participants were asked to recover
              balance following anteroposterior translations of the support
              surface at various intensities, while attempting to maintain both
              feet in place. We estimated source-resolved cortical activity
              using independent component analysis. Combining time-frequency
              decomposition and group-level general linear modeling of
              single-trial responses, we found a significant relation of the
              interaction between perturbation intensity and stepping responses
              with multiple cortical features from the midfrontal cortex,
              including the N1 potential, and theta, alpha, and beta rhythms.
              Our findings suggest that the cortical responses to balance
              perturbations index the magnitude of a deviation from a stable
              postural state to predict the need for reactive stepping
              responses. We propose that the cortical control of balance may
              involve cognitive control mechanisms (i.e., action monitoring)
              that facilitate postural adjustments to maintain postural
              stability.",

               mechanisms for orienting toward current task goals. While
               current evidence implicates gamma oscillatory activity in M1 as
               central to the execution of a movement, far less is known about
               top-down attentional modulation of this response. Herein, we

               M1 gamma responses by frontal attention networks in 63 healthy
               adult participants. MEG data were evaluated in the
               time-frequency domain and significant oscillatory responses were
               imaged using a beamformer. Robust increases in theta activity
               were found in bilateral inferior frontal gyri (IFG), with
               significantly stronger responses evident in trials that required
               attentional reorienting relative to those that did not.
               Additionally, strong gamma oscillations (60-80 Hz) were detected
               in M1 during movement execution, with similar responses elicited
               irrespective of attentional reorienting. Whole-brain voxel-wise
               correlations between validity difference scores (i.e., attention
               reorienting trials-nonreorienting trials) in frontal theta
               activity and movement-locked gamma oscillations revealed a
               robust relationship in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex,

               modulation of these sensorimotor network gamma responses by
               attentional reorienting. Importantly, the validity difference
               effect in this distributed motor network was predictive of
               overall motor function measured outside the scanner and further,
               based on a mediation analysis this relationship was fully
               mediated by the reallocation response in the right IFG. These

               is known to be correlated with the upcoming kinetics and
               kinematics of the hand. Yet recent work using visual-motor
               dissociation tasks suggests that M1 activity is also correlated
               with the visual consequences of an action, independent of the
               actual hand displacement. The goal of the present work was to
               investigate whether oscillatory activity over sensorimotor
               regions is modulated by the expectancy of visual reafferent
               feedback during reach planning. While recording
               electroencephalography (EEG), participants executed
               hand-reaching movements in a single direction (i.e.,
               straight-ahead of midline) throughout the entire experiment.
               Visual feedback of the hand was provided with a cursor and was
               manipulated. Specifically, before each trial, participants were
               precued as to the nature of the upcoming visual feedback, which
               could be spatially congruent with the hand, rotated leftward or
               rightward by 20° or not provided at all. Results revealed that

               electrodes was strongly modulated in the theta-band (3-7 Hz)
               depending on whether visual feedback would be available or not.
               In contrast, contralateral beta-band (15-30 Hz) activity did not

               low-frequency oscillatory dynamics during reach planning depend
               upon the upcoming availability of visual feedback. This may
               relate to predicting the visual consequences of the movement or
               to setting different feedback gains necessary for visually

               simultaneously applied at 6 Hz over left prefrontal and parietal
               cortices with a relative 0° (``synchronized'' condition) or 180°
               (``desynchronized'' condition) phase difference or a placebo
               stimulation condition, whereas healthy subjects performed a
               delayed letter discrimination task. We show that exogenously
               induced frontoparietal theta synchronization significantly
               improves visual memory-matching reaction times as compared to
               placebo stimulation. In contrast, exogenously induced
               frontoparietal theta desynchronization deteriorates performance.
               The present findings provide for the first time evidence of
               causality of theta phase-coupling of distant cortical areas for
               cognitive performance in healthy humans. Moreover, the results
               demonstrate the suitability of transcranial alternating current
               stimulation to artificially induce coupling or decoupling of
               behaviorally relevant brain rhythms between segregated cortical
               regions.",

               to ascribe a unitary function to the hippocampal formation
               (HPC). Rather, it is more productive to consider the hippocampal
               formation as consisting of a number of subsystems, each
               subsystem defined by its own particular neural circuitry. Among
               examples of neural circuitry appearing in current hippocampal
               literature are theta, beta and gamma oscillations, sharp waves,
               place cells and head orientation cells. Data are reviewed
               supporting the case that theta band oscillation and synchrony is
               involved in mechanisms underlying sensorimotor integration.
               Specifically, the neural circuitry underlying the production of
               oscillation and synchrony (theta) in limbic cortex and
               associated structures function in the capacity of providing
               voluntary motor systems with continually updated feedback on
               their performance relative to changing environmental (sensory)
               conditions. A crucial aspect of this performance is the
               intensity with which the motor programs are initiated and
               maintained. The ascending brainstem HPC synchronizing pathways
               make the primary contribution in this regard. These pathways
               originate in the rostral pontine region, ascend and synapse with
               caudal diencephalic nuclei, which in turn send projections to
               the medial septal region. The medial septum functions as the
               node in the ascending pathways, sending both cholinergic and
               GABA-ergic projections to the HPC. An updated version of the
               sensorimotor integration model including anatomical details is
               presented and discussed.",

               26: 1-54, 1986); however, it is unknown whether cortical theta
               activity underlies sensorimotor integration in humans. Rather,
               the mu rhythm (8-12 Hz) is typically found to desynchronize
               during movement. We measured oscillatory EEG activity for two
               conditions of an instructed delayed reaching paradigm.
               Conditions 1 and 2 were designed to differentially manipulate
               the contribution of the ventral visuomotor stream during the
               response initiation phase. We tested the hypothesis that theta
               activity would reflect changes in the relevant sensorimotor
               network: condition 2 engaged ventral stream mechanisms to a
               greater extent than condition 1. Theta oscillations were more
               prevalent during movement initiation and execution than during
               periods of stillness, consistent with a sensorimotor relevance
               for theta activity. Furthermore, theta activity was more
               prevalent at temporal sites in condition 2 than condition 1
               during response initiation, suggesting that theta activity is
               present within the necessary sensorimotor network. Mu activity
               desynchronized more during condition 2 than condition 1,
               suggesting mu desynchronization is also specific to the

               patients cannot express their feelings with language.
               Understanding what they are thinking about or how they feel is
               thus difficult. This study focused on brain responses to hearing
               their own names to clarify the situation in these patients.
               METHODS: We performed and analyzed electroencephalography (EEG)
               for six patients with SMID and eleven healthy subjects. All
               subjects were presented with auditory stimuli including calling
               the subject's own name (SON) and reading words. EEG was analyzed
               by time-frequency analysis, event-related spectral perturbation
               (ERSP) to detect EEG power changes caused by EEG amplitude, and
               inter-trial coherence (ITC) to investigate phase-locked changes.
               RESULTS: ERSP results from healthy subjects showed significant
               theta power increases as a specific response to SON. While we
               could not identify a similar pattern in the responses of
               patients with SMID, analysis of ITC revealed that theta
               phase-locked activity increased in response to SON not only in
               all healthy subjects, but also in four patients. DISCUSSION:
               These results indicate that theta phase-locked activity in some
               patients with SMID was strongly associated with SON, as in
               healthy subjects. Our study suggests the existence of specific
               neural markers that signal an attentional shift in patients upon
               hearing SON.",

               have shown that stimulating the parietal lobe, which plays a
               role in memory storage, can enhance performance during the
               ``retention'' process of working memory (WM). However, the
               mechanism of rTMS effect during this phase is still unclear. In
               this study, we stimulated the superior parietal lobe (SPL) using
               5-Hz rTMS in 26 participants and recorded electroencephalography
               (EEG) while they performed a delayed-recognition WM task. The
               analyses included the comparisons of event-related spectral
               perturbation (ERSP) value variations in theta (4-7 Hz) and alpha
               (8-14 Hz) band frequencies between conditions (rTMS vs. sham),
               as well as the correlations between different brain areas.
               Following rTMS, the ERSP values of theta-band oscillations were
               significantly increased in the parietal and occipital-parietal
               brain areas (P < 0.05*), whereas the ERSP values of alpha-band
               oscillations were significantly decreased in the parietal area
               (P < 0.05*). The ERSP value variations of theta-band
               oscillations between the two conditions in the left parietal and
               left prefrontal areas were positively correlated with the
               response time (RT) variations (by using rTMS, the more subject
               RT decreased, the more ERSP value of theta oscillation
               increased). The ERSP value variations of alpha-band oscillations
               in the left parietal and bilateral prefrontal areas were
               negatively correlated with RT variations (by using rTMS, the
               more RT of the subject decreased, the more ERSP value of alpha
               oscillation decreased). Inter-sites phase synchronization of
               theta-band EEG between the left parietal and left prefrontal
               areas, as well as alpha-band EEG between the left parietal and
               bilateral prefrontal areas were enhanced by rTMS. These results
               indicated that activities of both parietal and prefrontal areas
               were required for information storage, and these activities were
               related to the behavioral responses. Moreover, the connectivity
               between these two regions was intensified following rTMS. Thus,
               rTMS may affect the frontal area indirectly via the frontal

              previous studies have consistently shown explicit verbal memory
              impairment in schizophrenic patients. However, the mechanism of
              this impairment has not been fully revealed. Seventeen

              However, the difference between the old and new was larger in

              anterior-posterior theta-band phase synchrony as well. Our

               rehabilitation team and amputees themselves due to
               unavailability of a sound leg to provide stability in standing
               and gait. Although gait characteristics of individuals with
               unilateral transtibial amputations are well documented in the
               literature, very less is known about those with bilateral limb

               with bilateral transtibial amputation (BTA) and its comparison
               with an able-bodied (AB). This study also provides a real-life

               temporal?spatial parameters revealed that the individual with
               BTA walked with slower speed, lower cadence, shorter step

               Aim: Measuring the exact placement of probes (e.g., electrodes
               and optodes) on a participant's head is a notoriously difficult
               step in acquiring neuroimaging data from methods that rely on
               scalp recordings (e.g., electroencephalography and functional
               near-infrared spectroscopy) and is particularly difficult for
               any clinical or developmental population. Existing methods of
               head measurements require the participant to remain still for a
               lengthy period of time, are laborious, and require extensive
               training. Therefore, a fast and motion-resilient method is
               required for estimating the scalp location of probes. Approach:
               We propose an innovative video-based method for estimating the
               probes' positions relative to the participant's head, which is
               fast, motion-resilient, and automatic. Our method builds on
               capitalizing the advantages and understanding the limitations of
               cutting-edge computer vision and machine learning tools. We
               validate our method on 10 adult subjects and provide proof of
               feasibility with infant subjects. Results: We show that our
               method is both reliable and valid compared to existing
               state-of-the-art methods by estimating probe positions in a
               single measurement and by tracking their translation and
               consistency across sessions. Finally, we show that our automatic
               method is able to estimate the position of probes on an infant
               head without lengthy offline procedures, a task that has been
               considered challenging until now. Conclusions: Our proposed
               method allows, for the first time, the use of automated spatial
               co-registration methods on developmental and clinical

               single-leg stance, and fast walking using ASR with 10 cut-off

               repeatability and dipolarity of independent components to assess
               their quality and an automatic classification tool to assess the
               number of brain-related independent components. The cut-off
               parameter equivalent to the ratio of EEG removed in manual
               cleaning was strictest for the walking task. The quality index

               maximum plateau for cut-off parameters of 10 and higher across

               performed better in motor tasks compared with non-movement
               tasks. The quality index seemed to be more sensitive to changes
               induced by ASR compared to dipolarity. There was no benefit of

               (RSNs). Other brain imaging techniques, such as
               electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG),
               have been used for investigating the electrophysiological basis
               of RSNs. To date, it is largely unclear how neural oscillations
               measured with EEG and MEG are related to functional connectivity
               in the resting state. In addition, it remains to be elucidated
               whether and how the observed neural oscillations are related to
               the spatial distribution of the network nodes over the cortex.
               To address these questions, we examined frequency-dependent
               functional connectivity between the main nodes of several RSNs,
               spanning large part of the cortex. We estimated connectivity
               using band-limited power correlations from high-density EEG data

               beta (13?30?Hz), and gamma (30?80?Hz) bands, which highly depend

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Accurate source localization from
               electroencephalography (EEG) requires electrode co-registration
               to brain anatomy, a process that depends on precise measurement
               of 3D scalp locations. Stylus digitizers and camera-based
               scanners for such measurements require the subject to remain
               still and therefore are not ideal for young children or those
               with movement disorders. NEW METHOD: Motion capture accurately
               measures electrode position in one frame but marker placement
               adds significant setup time, particularly in high-density EEG.
               We developed an algorithm, named MoLo and implemented as an
               open-source MATLAB toolbox, to compute 3D electrode coordinates
               from a subset of positions measured in motion capture using
               spline interpolation. Algorithm accuracy was evaluated across 5
               different-sized head models. RESULTS: MoLo interpolation reduced
               setup time by approximately 10 min for 64-channel EEG. Mean
               electrode interpolation error was 2.95 $\pm$ 1.3 mm (range:
               0.38-7.98 mm). Source localization errors with interpolated
               compared to true electrode locations were below 1 mm and 0.1 mm
               in 75 \% and 35 \% of dipoles, respectively. COMPARISON WITH
               EXISTING METHODS: MoLo location accuracy is comparable to stylus
               digitizers and camera-scanners, common in clinical research. The
               MoLo algorithm could be deployed with other tools beyond motion
               capture, e.g., a stylus, to extract high-density EEG electrode
               locations from a subset of measured positions. The algorithm is
               particularly useful for research involving young children and
               others who cannot remain still for extended time periods.
               CONCLUSIONS: Electrode position and source localization errors
               with MoLo are similar to other modalities supporting its use to
               measure high-density EEG electrode positions in research and
               clinical settings.",

              one-digit number sounds (single syllable). The subjects were
              asked to make switch response (for SRP) or accumulative summation
              (for SMA) as soon as odd numbers (T) were heard and to ignore

              segments post input signal from 9 locations on scalp in 4
              conditions (srT, srN, maT and maN). The ERSP was taken as the
              spectral change relative to that under rest control. The main
              results were: (i) the power of delta and theta activity increased
              significantly in the 1st 0.5 s in all 4 conditions but decreased
              in the following epochs; (ii) the theta activity revealed
              greatest spatial differentiation, prominent theta activity
              remained at Fz in the 2nd and 3rd 0.5 s in maT but not in srT;
              (iii) the power of alpha activity was lowest in the 1st 0.5 s and
              remained low level during SMA but increased in the 2nd 0.5 s
              during SRP; (iv) the 11-18 Hz activity augmented after the 1st
              0.5 s, its dominance remained at P6 during SMA but switched from
              P6 to frontal locations during SRP; (v) the power of high
              frequency activities beyond 30 Hz decreased significantly during
              SRP at all locations. The temporal and spatial feature of ERSP in
              the 4 conditions provided further evidence indicating the
              functional correlates of EEG activities in each frequency band.
              The high frequency activity might reflect the general attention
              state. The dynamic change of attentional demand during
              information processing was probably reflected by alpha activity.
              The delta, theta and beta activities seemed related to different
              aspects of cognitive processes.",

              non-clinical settings, HRV is often computed from signals

              calculate time-varying metrics. The algorithm is designed for raw

              the mathematical framework of graph signal processing in order to
              derive the Fourier modes of the brain structural connectivity
              graph, or ``network harmonics''. These network harmonics are
              naturally ordered by smoothness. Smoothness in this context can
              be understood as the amount of variation along the cortex,
              leading to a multi-scale representation of brain connectivity. We
              demonstrate that network harmonics provide a sparse
              representation of the EEG signal, where, at certain times, the
              smoothest 15 network harmonics capture 90\% of the signal power.
              This suggests that network harmonics are functionally meaningful,
              which we demonstrate by using them as a basis for the functional
              EEG data recorded from a face detection task. There, only 13
              network harmonics are sufficient to track the large-scale
              cortical activity during the processing of the stimuli with a 50
              ​ms resolution, reproducing well-known activity in the fusiform

              used pre-processing procedure that allows detection of
              significant coherence between EMG and measured cortical signals.
              However, despite its accepted and wide-spread use, no detailed
              analysis has been presented to offer insight into the precise
              function of rectification. We begin this paper with arguments
              based on single motor unit action potential (AP) trains to
              demonstrate that rectification effectively enhances the firing
              rate information of the signal. Enhancement is achieved by
              shifting the peak of the AP spectrum toward the lower firing rate
              frequencies, whilst maintaining the firing rate spectra. A
              similar result is obtained using the analytic envelope of the
              signal extracted using the Hilbert transform. This argument is
              extended to simulated EMG signals generated using a published EMG
              model. Detection of firing rate frequencies is obtained using
              phase randomised surrogate data, where the original EMG power
              spectrum exceeds the averaged rectified surrogate spectra at
              integer multiples of firing rate frequencies. Model simulations
              demonstrate that this technique accurately determines grouped

              recorded from sensorimotor cortex (EEG or MEG) and the
              electromyogram (EMG) of active muscles. In motor neuroscience,
              rectification of the surface EMG is a common pre-processing step
              prior to calculating CMC, intended to maximize information about
              action potential timing, whilst suppressing information relating
              to motor unit action potential (MUAP) shape. Rectification is
              believed to produce a general shift in the EMG spectrum towards
              lower frequencies, including those around the mean motor unit
              discharge rate. However, there are no published data to support
              the claim that EMG rectification enhances the detection of CMC.
              Furthermore, performing coherence analysis after the non-linear
              procedure of rectification, which results in a significant
              distortion of the EMG spectrum, is considered fundamentally
              flawed in engineering and digital signal processing. We

              was there any evidence that MUAP shape information had an adverse
              effect on the CMC estimation. EMG rectification had inconsistent
              effects on the power and coherence spectra and obscured the
              detection of CMC in some cases. We also provide a comprehensive
              theoretical analysis, which, along with our empirical data,
              demonstrates that rectification is neither necessary nor

  abstract = "Background: Electrophysiological recordings of the brain often
              exhibit neural oscillations, defined as narrowband bumps that
              deviate from the background power spectrum. These narrowband
              dynamics are grouped into frequency ranges, and the study of how
              activities in these ranges are related to cognition and disease
              is a major part of the neuroscience corpus. Frequency ranges are
              nearly always defined according to integer boundaries, such as
              4-8 Hz for the theta band and 8-12 Hz for the alpha band. New
              method: A data-driven multivariate method is presented to
              identify empirical frequency boundaries based on clustering of
              spatiotemporal similarities across a range of frequencies. The
              method, termed gedBounds, identifies patterns in covariance
              matrices that maximally separate narrowband from broadband
              activity, and then identifies clusters in the correlation matrix
              of those spatial patterns over all frequencies. Those clusters
              are empirically derived frequency bands, from which boundaries
              can be extracted. Results: gedBounds recovers ground truth
              results in simulated data with high accuracy. The method was
              tested on EEG resting-state data from Parkinson's patients and
              control, and several features of the frequency components
              differed between patients and controls. Comparison with existing
              methods: The proposed method offers higher precision in defining
              subject-specific frequency boundaries compared to the current
              standard approach. Conclusions: gedBounds can increase the
              precision and feature extraction of spectral dynamics in

                   proliferation of different approaches that promise to catch
                   the underlying correlation among the (interacting) units.
                   This issue has probably contributed to hinder the comparison
                   among different studies. Not only all these approaches go
                   under the same name (functional connectivity) but they have
                   been often tested and validated using different methods,

              currently not be predicted in simulations where muscle activation
              or metabolic energy is minimised. Here, we intend to show that

              systems with random uncertainty. Secondly, we aim to show that
              this is because of mechanical muscle properties and time delay.
              We used a model of a one-degree-of-freedom arm, actuated by two
              identical antagonistic muscles, and solved optimal control
              problems to find the controller that minimised muscular effort
              while remaining upright in the presence of noise with different
              levels. Tasks were defined by bound-ing the maximum deviation
              from the upright position, representing different levels of
              difficulty. We found that a controller with co-contraction
              required less effort than purely reactive control. Furthermore,
              co-contraction was optimal even without ac-tivation dynamics,
              since nonzero activation still allowed for faster force

              tasks, represented by a small maxi-mum deviation, or in systems
              with high uncertainty. The ability of models to predict
              co-contraction from effort or energy minimization has important
              clinical and sports applications. If co-contraction is

  abstract = "Studies of selective attention typically consider the role of
              task goals or physical salience, but attention can also be
              captured by previously reward-associated stimuli, even if they
              are currently task irrelevant. One theory underlying this
              value-driven attentional capture (VDAC) is that reward-associated
              stimulus representations undergo plasticity in sensory cortex,
              thereby automatically capturing attention during early
              processing. To test this, we used magnetoencephalography to probe
              whether stimulus location and identity representations in sensory
              cortex are modulated by reward learning. We furthermore
              investigated the time course of these neural effects, and their
              relationship to behavioral VDAC. Male and female human
              participants first learned stimulus-reward associations. Next, we
              measured VDAC in a separate task by presenting these stimuli in
              the absence of reward contingency and probing their effects on
              the processing of separate target stimuli presented at different
              time lags. Using time-resolved multivariate pattern analysis, we
              found that learned value modulated the spatial selection of
              previously rewarded stimuli in posterior visual and parietal
              cortex from ∼260 ms after stimulus onset. This value modulation
              was related to the strength of participants' behavioral VDAC
              effect and persisted into subsequent target processing.
              Importantly, learned value did not influence cortical signatures
              of early processing (i.e., earlier than ∼200 ms); nor did it
              influence the decodability of stimulus identity. Our results
              suggest that VDAC is underpinned by learned value signals that
              modulate spatial selection throughout posterior visual and
              parietal cortex. We further suggest that VDAC can occur in the
              absence of changes in early visual processing in
              cortex.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Attention is our ability to focus
              on relevant information at the expense of irrelevant information.
              It can be affected by previously learned but currently irrelevant
              stimulus-reward associations, a phenomenon termed ``value-driven
              attentional capture'' (VDAC). The neural mechanisms underlying
              VDAC remain unclear. It has been speculated that reward learning
              induces visual cortical plasticity, which modulates early visual
              processing to capture attention. Although we find that learned
              value modulates spatial signals in visual cortical areas, an
              effect that correlates with VDAC, we find no relevant signatures
              of changes in early visual processing in cortex.",

  abstract = "Perception is a process of inference, integrating sensory inputs
              with prior expectations. However, little is known regarding the
              temporal dynamics of this integration. It has been proposed that
              expectation plays a role early in the perceptual process, biasing
              sensory processing. Alternatively, others suggest that
              expectations are integrated only at later, post-perceptual
              decision-making stages. The current study aimed to dissociate
              between these hypotheses. We exposed human participants (male and
              female) to auditory cues predicting the likely direction of
              upcoming moving dot patterns, while recording neural activity
              using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Participants' reports of the
              moving dot directions were biased towards the direction predicted
              by the cues. To investigate when expectations affected sensory
              representations, we used inverted encoding models to decode the
              direction represented in early sensory signals. Strikingly, the
              cues modulated the direction represented in the MEG signal as
              early as 150 ms after visual stimulus onset. While this may not
              reflect a modulation of the initial feedforward sweep, it does
              reveal a modulation of early sensory representations. Exploratory
              analyses showed that the neural modulation was related to
              perceptual expectation effects: participants with a stronger
              perceptual bias towards the predicted direction also revealed a
              stronger reflection of the predicted direction in the MEG signal.
              For participants with this perceptual bias, a correlation between
              decoded and perceived direction already emerged prior to visual
              stimulus onset, suggesting that the pre-stimulus state of the
              visual cortex influences sensory processing. Together, these
              results suggest that expectations play an integral role in the
              neural computations underlying perception.Significance
              StatementPerception can be thought of as an inferential process
              in which our brains integrate sensory inputs with prior
              expectations to make sense of the world. This study investigated
              whether this integration occurs early or late in the process of
              perception. We exposed human participants to auditory cues which
              predicted the likely direction of visual moving dots, while
              recording neural activity with millisecond resolution using
              magnetoencephalography (MEG). Participants' perceptual reports of
              the direction of the moving dots were biased towards the
              predicted direction. Additionally, the predicted direction
              modulated the neural representation of the moving dots just 150
              ms after they appeared. This suggests that prior expectations
              affected sensory processing at early stages, playing an integral
              role in the perceptual process.",

  abstract = "Reward has a remarkable ability to invigorate motor behavior,
              enabling individuals to select and execute actions with greater
              precision and speed. However, if reward is to be exploited in
              applied settings, such as rehabilitation, a thorough
              understanding of its underlying mechanisms is required. In a
              series of experiments, we first demonstrate that reward
              simultaneously improves the selection and execution components of
              a reaching movement. Specifically, reward promoted the selection
              of the correct action in the presence of distractors, while also
              improving execution through increased speed and maintenance of
              accuracy. These results led to a shift in the speed-accuracy
              functions for both selection and execution. In addition,
              punishment had a similar impact on action selection and
              execution, although it enhanced execution performance across all
              trials within a block, that is, its impact was noncontingent to
              trial value. Although the reward-driven enhancement of movement
              execution has been proposed to occur through enhanced feedback
              control, an untested possibility is that it is also driven by
              increased arm stiffness, an energy-consuming process that
              enhances limb stability. Computational analysis revealed that
              reward led to both an increase in feedback correction in the
              middle of the movement and a reduction in motor noise near the
              target. In line with our hypothesis, we provide novel evidence
              that this noise reduction is driven by a reward-dependent
              increase in arm stiffness. Therefore, reward drives multiple
              error-reduction mechanisms which enable individuals to invigorate
              motor performance without compromising accuracy.SIGNIFICANCE
              STATEMENT While reward is well-known for enhancing motor
              performance, how the nervous system generates these improvements
              is unclear. Despite recent work indicating that reward leads to
              enhanced feedback control, an untested possibility is that it
              also increases arm stiffness. We demonstrate that reward
              simultaneously improves the selection and execution components of
              a reaching movement. Furthermore, we show that punishment has a
              similar positive impact on performance. Importantly, by combining
              computational and biomechanical approaches, we show that reward
              leads to both improved feedback correction and an increase in
              stiffness. Therefore, reward drives multiple error-reduction
              mechanisms which enable individuals to invigorate performance
              without compromising accuracy. This work suggests that stiffness
              control plays a vital, and underappreciated, role in the

              control with the reality of hierarchical cortical processing and
              the parallel segregated loops that characterize
              cortical-subcortical connections. We also incorporate the recent
              claim that cortex functions via predictive representation and
              optimal information utilization. Our framework assumes each
              cortical area engaged in motor control generates a predictive
              model of a different aspect of motor behavior. In maintaining
              these predictive models, each area interacts with a different
              part of the cerebellum and BG. These subcortical areas are thus
              engaged in domain-appropriate system identification and
              optimization. This refocuses the question of division of function
              among different cortical areas. What are the different aspects of
              motor behavior that are predictively modeled? We suggest that one
              fundamental division is between modeling of task and body whereas
              another is the model of state and action. Thus, we propose that
              the posterior parietal cortex, somatosensory cortex, premotor
              cortex, and motor cortex represent task state, body state, task
              action, and body action, respectively. In the second part of this

              account for many recent findings of movement encoding, especially
              in the premotor and posterior parietal cortices.",

              compared the rat hippocampal slow oscillations in the
              multisensory-rich real world (RW) and in a body-fixed, visual
              virtual reality (VR). The amplitude and rhythmicity of the

              was accompanied by the emergence of a ~4 Hz oscillation, termed
              the eta rhythm, evident in the local field potential (LFP) in VR,
              but not in RW. Similar to theta, eta band amplitude increased
              with running speed in VR, but not in RW. However, contrary to
              theta, eta amplitude was highest in the CA1 cell layer,
              implicating intra-CA1 mechanisms. Consistently, putative CA1

              oscillatory activity within the motor cortex and effective neural
              communication between the motor cortex and other brain areas.
              Oscillatory activity within the beta-band (13-30Hz) has been
              suggested to provide distinct functional roles for attention and
              sensorimotor control, yet it remains unclear how beta-band and
              other oscillatory activity within and between cortical regions is
              coordinated to enhance motor performance. We explore this open
              issue by simultaneously measuring high-density cortical activity
              and elbow flexor and extensor neuromuscular activity during
              ballistic movements, and manipulating error using high and low
              visual gain across three target distances. Compared with low
              visual gain, high visual gain decreased movement errors at each
              distance. Group analyses in 3D source-space revealed increased
              theta-, alpha-, and beta-band desynchronization of the
              contralateral motor cortex and medial parietal cortex in high
              visual gain conditions and this corresponded to reduced movement
              error. Dynamic causal modeling was used to compute connectivity
              between motor cortex and parietal cortex. Analyses revealed that
              gain affected the directionally-specific connectivity across
              broadband frequencies from parietal to sensorimotor cortex but
              not from sensorimotor cortex to parietal cortex. These new
              findings provide support for the interpretation that broad-band
              oscillations in theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands within
              sensorimotor and parietal cortex coordinate to facilitate
              accurate upper limb movement. SUMMARY STATEMENT: Our findings
              establish a link between sensorimotor oscillations in the context
              of online motor performance in common source space across
              subjects. Specifically, the extent and distinct role of medial

              domain broadband activity combine in a time and frequency manner
              to assist ballistic movements. These findings can serve as a

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Categorical perception (CP) is an inherent property of
              speech perception. The response time (RT) of listeners'
              perceptual speech identification is highly sensitive to
              individual differences. While the neural correlates of CP have
              been well studied in terms of the regional contributions of the
              brain to behavior, functional connectivity patterns that signify
              individual differences in listeners' speed (RT) for speech
              categorization is less clear. In this study, we introduce a novel
              approach to address these questions. APPROACH: We applied several
              computational approaches to the EEG, including graph mining,
              machine learning (i.e., support vector machine), and stability
              selection to investigate the unique brain states (functional
              neural connectivity) that predict the speed of listeners'
              behavioral decisions. MAIN RESULTS: We infer that (i) the
              listeners' perceptual speed is directly related to dynamic
              variations in their brain connectomics, (ii) global network
              assortativity and efficiency distinguished fast, medium, and slow
              RTs, (iii) the functional network underlying speeded decisions
              increases in negative assortativity (i.e., became disassortative)
              for slower RTs, (iv) slower categorical speech decisions cause
              excessive use of neural resources and more aberrant information
              flow within the CP circuitry, (v) slower responders tended to
              utilize functional brain networks excessively (or
              inappropriately) whereas fast responders (with lower global
              efficiency) utilized the same neural pathways but with more
              restricted organization. SIGNIFICANCE: Findings show that neural
              classifiers (SVM) coupled with stability selection correctly
              classify behavioral RTs from functional connectivity alone with
              over 92\% accuracy (AUC = 0.9). Our results corroborate previous

              noise from both rfMRI and task-based fMRI data to larger extent
              than regression using 24 motion parameters or spike regression.

              across datasets without requiring classifier re-training, and
              preserves the temporal characteristics of the fMRI data.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Patients with chronic stroke have been shown to have
              failure to release interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) from the
              intact to the damaged hemisphere before movement execution
              (premovement IHI). This inhibitory imbalance was found to
              correlate with poor motor performance in the chronic stage after
              stroke and has since become a target for therapeutic
              interventions. The logic of this approach, however, implies that
              abnormal premovement IHI is causal to poor behavioral outcome and
              should therefore be present early after stroke when motor
              impairment is at its worst. To test this idea, in a longitudinal
              study, we investigated interhemispheric interactions by tracking
              patients' premovement IHI for one year following stroke. METHODS:
              We assessed premovement IHI and motor behavior five times over a
              1-year period after ischemic stroke in 22 patients and 11 healthy
              participants. RESULTS: We found that premovement IHI was normal
              during the acute/subacute period and only became abnormal at the
              chronic stage; specifically, release of IHI in movement
              preparation worsened as motor behavior improved. In addition,
              premovement IHI did not correlate with behavioral measures
              cross-sectionally, whereas the longitudinal emergence of abnormal
              premovement IHI from the acute to the chronic stage was inversely
              correlated with recovery of finger individuation. INTERPRETATION:
              These results suggest that interhemispheric imbalance is not a
              cause of poor motor recovery, but instead might be the
              consequence of underlying recovery processes. These findings call
              into question the rehabilitation strategy of attempting to

              replicating FreeSurfer's anatomical segmentation including
              surface reconstruction and cortical parcellation. To this end, we
              introduce an advanced deep learning architecture capable of whole
              brain segmentation into 95 classes. The network architecture
              incorporates local and global competition via competitive dense
              blocks and competitive skip pathways, as well as multi-slice
              information aggregation that specifically tailor network
              performance towards accurate segmentation of both cortical and

                 of attention and cognition under natural viewing conditions.
                 In the past, four methodological problems have complicated the
                 analysis of such combined eye-tracking/EEG experiments: (i)
                 the synchronization of data streams, (ii) the removal of
                 ocular artifacts, (iii) the condition-specific temporal
                 overlap between the brain responses evoked by consecutive
                 fixations, (iv) and the fact that numerous low-level stimulus
                 and saccade properties also influence the post-saccadic neural
                 responses. While effective solutions exist for the first two
                 problems, the latter ones are only beginning to be addressed.
                 In the current paper, we present and review a unified
                 framework for FRP analysis that allows us to deconvolve
                 overlapping potentials and control for linear and nonlinear
                 confounds on the FRPs. An open software implementation is
                 provided for all procedures. We then demonstrate the
                 advantages of this approach for data from three commonly
                 studied paradigms: face perception, scene viewing, and natural
                 sentence reading. First, for a traditional ERP face
                 recognition experiment, we show how deconvolution can separate
                 stimulus-ERPs from overlapping muscle and brain potentials
                 produced by small (micro)saccades on the face. Second, in
                 scene viewing, we isolate multiple non-linear influences of
                 saccade parameters on the FRP. Finally, for a natural sentence
                 reading experiment using the boundary paradigm, we show how it
                 is possible to study the neural correlates of parafoveal
                 preview after removing spurious overlap effects caused by the
                 associated difference in average fixation time. Our results
                 suggest a principal way of measuring reliable fixation-related

              Correct identification of sensor positions is fundamental for
              accurately estimating neural activity from hdEEG recordings. We
              previously introduced a method of automated localization and
              labelling of hdEEG sensors using an infrared colour-enhanced 3D
              scanner. Here, we describe an extension of this method, the

              information contributes to voluntary gait modification. In this
              study, we investigated cortical activity changes associated with
              visually guided precision stepping using EEG source analysis. Our
              results demonstrated frequency- and gait-event-dependent changes
              in the cortical power spectrum elicited by voluntary gait
              modification. The main differences between normal walking and
              precision stepping were as follows: 1) the alpha, beta, or gamma
              power decrease during the swing phases in the sensorimotor,
              anterior cingulate and parieto-occipital cortices, and 2) a power
              decrease in the theta, alpha and beta bands and increase in the
              gamma band throughout the gait-cycle in the parieto-occipital
              cortex. Based on the previous knowledge of brain functions, the
              former change was considered to be related to execution and
              planning of leg movement, while the latter change was considered
              to be related to multisensory integration and motor awareness.
              Therefore, our results suggest that the gait modification is
              achieved by higher cortical involvements associated with
              different sensorimotor related functions across multiple cortical
              regions including the sensorimotor, anterior cingulate and
              parieto-occipital cortices. The results imply the critical
              importance of the cortical contribution to voluntary modification
              in human locomotion. Further, the observed cortical information
              related to voluntary gait modification would contribute to
              developing volitional control systems of brain-machine interfaces

              more recently from recordings of large numbers of neurons through
              calcium imaging, reveal that many cognitive, emotional, and motor
              functions depend on the multivariate interactions of neuronal
              populations. To capture and characterize spatiotemporal
              properties of brain events, we propose an architecture based on
              long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to uncover distributed
              spatiotemporal signatures during dynamic experimental conditions.
              We demonstrate the potential of the approach using naturalistic
              movie-watching fMRI data. We show that movie clips result in
              complex but distinct spatiotemporal patterns in brain data that
              can be classified using LSTMs ($\approx$90\% for 15-way
              classification), demonstrating that learned representations
              generalized to unseen participants. LSTMs were also superior to
              existing methods in predicting behavior and personality traits of
              individuals. We propose a dimensionality reduction approach that
              uncovers low-dimensional trajectories and captures essential
              informational properties of brain dynamics. Finally, we employed
              saliency maps to characterize spatiotemporally-varying
              brain-region importance. The spatiotemporal saliency maps
              revealed dynamic but consistent changes in fMRI activation data.
              We believe our approach provides a powerful framework for
              visualizing, analyzing, and discovering dynamic spatially
              distributed brain representations during naturalistic conditions.

               functional brain images. Analyzed generative models include
               classic approaches such as the Gaussian mixture model (GMM), and
               modern implicit generative models such as the generative
               adversarial network (GAN) and the variational autoencoder (VAE).
               In particular, the proposed GAN and VAE models utilize
               3-dimensional convolutions, which enables modeling of
               high-dimensional brain image tensors with structured spatial

  abstract = "Functional connectivity (FC), thought to provide a window into
              neural communication, has become a core focus in the study of
              brain function and cognition. However, there is no consensus on
              how to conceptualize large-scale FC in electrophysiology. Phase
              coupling (PhC), defined as coupling between the phases of two
              signals, reflects the synchronization of rhythmic oscillation
              cycles. Conversely, amplitude coupling (AmpC), defined as
              coupling between the envelopes of two signals, reflects
              correlation of activation amplitude. Despite quantifying
              different electrophysiological properties, the relationship
              between PhC and AmpC remains largely unknown. We assessed spatial
              and temporal correspondence between PhC and AmpC over 5 canonical
              frequency bands during a cue-based motor task using
              electrocorticography (ECoG) in 18 patients (8 females) undergoing
              presurgical monitoring. Significant correspondence between the
              spatial pattern of PhC and AmpC was detected during stimulus
              processing across all subjects and frequency bands
              (R$\approx$0.50 for theta, decreasing with increasing frequency).
              The cross-measure spatial correlation vanished almost entirely
              when accounting for the portion of FC equally present during pre-
              and post-stimulus intervals, suggesting that the spatial
              correlations reflect intrinsic FC independent of stimulus
              processing. Stimulus-related processing modulated both PhC and
              AmpC, however in a spatially independent manner. Examining the
              linear temporal correlation, we found no evidence for linear
              dependence between PhC and AmpC. Supporting the robustness of our
              findings, results extended to a verb generation task in a second
              ECoG dataset of 6 subjects. We conclude that PhC and AmpC reflect
              intrinsic FC similarly across space, but exhibit divergent
              stimulus-related FC changes over space and time.",

                   to accurately detect human intentions using brain signals in
                   the real world. However, the electroencephalography (EEG)
                   signals are distorted owing to the artifacts such as walking
                   and head movement, so brain signals may be large in
                   amplitude rather than desired EEG signals. Due to these
                   artifacts, detecting accurately human intention in the
                   mobile environment is challenging. In this paper, we
                   proposed the reconstruction framework based on generative
                   adversarial networks using the event-related potentials
                   (ERP) during walking. We used a pre-trained convolutional
                   encoder to represent latent variables and reconstructed ERP
                   through the generative model which shape similar to the

                   the discriminative model to demonstrate the validity of our
                   proposed framework. As a result, the reconstructed signals
                   had important components such as N200 and P300 similar to
                   ERP during standing. The accuracy of reconstructed EEG was
                   similar to raw noisy EEG signals during walking. The
                   signal-to-noise ratio of reconstructed EEG was significantly
                   increased as 1.3. The loss of the generative model was
                   0.6301, which is comparatively low, which means training
                   generative model had high performance. The reconstructed ERP
                   consequentially showed an improvement in classification
                   performance during walking through the effects of noise
                   reduction. The proposed framework could help recognize human
                   intention based on the brain-machine interface even in the

              magnetic resonance imaging data have been brought forward more
              than a decade ago and have significantly matured since. Similar

  abstract = "UNLABELLED: In a recent study, Tan et al. (2014a,b) showed that
              the increase in $\beta$-power typically observed after a movement
              above sensorimotor regions ($\beta$-rebound) is attenuated when
              movement-execution errors are induced by visual perturbations.
              Moreover, akin to sensorimotor adaptation, the effect depended on
              the context in which the errors are experienced. Thus the
              $\beta$-rebound attenuation might relate to neural processes
              involved in trial-to-trial adaptive mechanisms. In two EEG
              experiments with human participants, along with the
              $\beta$-rebound, we examine $\beta$-activity during the
              preparation of reaches immediately following perturbed movements.
              In the first experiment, we show that both foreperiod and
              postmovement $\beta$-activities are parametrically modulated by
              the sizes of kinematic errors produced by unpredictable
              mechanical perturbations (force field) independent of their
              on-line corrections. In the second experiment, we contrast two
              types of reach errors: movement-execution errors that trigger
              trial-to-trial adaptive mechanisms and goal errors that do not
              elicit sensorimotor adaptation. Movement-execution errors were
              induced by mechanical or visual perturbations, whereas goal
              errors were caused by unexpected displacements of the target at
              movement initiation. Interestingly, foreperiod and postmovement
              $\beta$-activities exhibit contrasting patterns, pointing to
              important functional differences of their underlying neuronal
              activity. While both types of reach errors attenuate the
              postmovement $\beta$-rebound, only the kinematic errors that
              trigger trial-to-trial motor-command updates influenced
              $\beta$-activity during the foreperiod. These findings suggest
              that the error-related modulation of the $\beta$-rebound may
              reflect salience processing, independent of sensorimotor
              adaptation. In contrast, modulations in the foreperiod
              $\beta$-power might relate to the motor-command adjustments
              activated after movement-execution errors are experienced.
              SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The functional significance of
              sensorimotor $\beta$-band (15-25 Hz) oscillations remains
              uncertain. Recently $\beta$-power was found to be reduced
              following erroneous movements. We extend and refine this novel
              finding in two crucial ways. First, by contrasting the EEG
              correlates of movement errors driving or not driving adaptation
              we dissociate error-salience processing from error-based
              adaptation. Second, in addition to $\beta$-activity in error
              trials, we examine $\beta$-power during the preparation of the
              subsequent movements. We find clearly distinct patterns of
              error-related modulations for $\beta$-activities preceding and
              succeeding movements, highlighting critical functional
              differences. Postmovement $\beta$-power may reflect
              error-salience processing independent of sensorimotor adaptation.
              In contrast, modulations in the foreperiod $\beta$-band power may
              directly relate to the motor-command adjustments activated after
              movement-execution errors are experienced.",

  abstract = "It has been shown that when incentives are provided during
              movement preparation, activity in parieto-frontal regions
              reflects both expected value and motivational salience. Yet
              behavioral work suggests that the processing of rewards is faster
              than for punishments, raising the possibility that expected value
              and motivational salience manifest at different latencies during
              movement planning. Given the role of beta oscillations (13-30 Hz)
              in movement preparation and in communication within the reward
              circuit, this study investigated how beta activity is modulated
              by positive and negative monetary incentives during reach
              planning, and in particular whether it reflects expected value
              and motivational salience at different latencies.
              Electroencephalography was recorded while male and female humans
              performed a reaching task in which reward or punishment delivery
              depended on movement accuracy. Before a preparatory delay period,
              participants were informed of the consequences of hitting or
              missing the target, according to four experimental conditions:
              Neutral (hit/miss:+0/-0\textcent{}), Reward
              (hit/miss:+5/-0\textcent{}), Punish (hit/miss:+0/-5\textcent{})
              and Mixed (hit/miss:+5/-5\textcent{}). Results revealed that beta
              power over parieto-frontal regions was strongly modulated by
              incentives during the delay period, with power positively
              correlating with movement times. Interestingly, beta power was
              selectively sensitive to potential rewards early in the delay
              period, after which it came to reflect motivational salience as
              movement onset neared. These results demonstrate that beta
              activity reflects expected value and motivational salience on
              different time scales during reach planning. They also provide
              support for models that link beta activity with basal ganglia and
              dopamine for the allocation of neural resources according to
              behavioral salience.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The present work
              demonstrates that pre-movement parieto-frontal beta power is
              modulated by monetary incentives in a goal-directed reaching
              task. Specifically, beta power transiently scaled with the
              availability of rewards early in movement planning, before
              reflecting motivational salience as movement onset neared.
              Moreover, pre-movement beta activity correlated with the vigor of
              the upcoming movement. These findings suggest that beta
              oscillations reflect neural processes that mediate the
              invigorating effect of incentives on motor performance, possibly
              through dopamine-mediated interactions with the basal ganglia.",

  abstract = "It is well documented that providing advanced information
              regarding the spatial location of a target stimulus (i.e.,
              spatial anticipation) or its timing of occurrence (i.e., temporal
              anticipation) influences reach preparation, reducing RTs. Yet, it
              remains unknown whether the RT gains attributable to temporal and
              spatial anticipation are subtended by similar preparatory
              dynamics. Here, this issue is addressed in humans by
              investigating EEG beta-band activity during reach preparation.
              Participants performed a reach RT task in which they initiated a
              movement as fast as possible toward visual targets following
              their appearance. Temporal anticipation was manipulated by having
              the target appear after a constant or variable delay period,
              whereas spatial anticipation was manipulated by precueing
              participants about the upcoming target location in advance or
              not. Results revealed that temporal and spatial anticipation both
              reduced reach RTs, with no interaction. Interestingly, temporal
              and spatial anticipation were associated with fundamentally
              different patterns of beta-band modulations. Temporal
              anticipation was associated with beta-band desynchronization over
              contralateral sensorimotor regions specifically around the
              expected moment of target onset, the magnitude of which was
              correlated with RT modulations across participants. In contrast,
              spatial anticipation did not influence sensorimotor activity but
              rather led to increased beta-band power over bilateral
              parieto-occipital regions during the entire delay period. These
              results argue for distinct states of preparation incurred by
              temporal and spatial anticipation. In particular, sensorimotor
              beta-band desynchronization may reflect the timely disinhibition
              of movement-related neuronal ensembles at the expected time of
              movement initiation, without reflecting its spatial parameters

  abstract = "Recent developments in EEG hardware and analyses approaches allow
              for recordings in both stationary and mobile settings.
              Irrespective of the experimental setting, EEG recordings are
              contaminated with noise that has to be removed before the data
              can be functionally interpreted. Independent component analysis
              (ICA) is a commonly used tool to remove artifacts such as eye
              movement, muscle activity, and external noise from the data and
              to analyze activity on the level of EEG effective brain sources.
              While the effectiveness of filtering the data as one key
              preprocessing step to improve the decomposition has been
              investigated previously, no study thus far compared the different
              requirements of mobile and stationary experiments regarding the
              preprocessing for ICA decomposition. We thus evaluated how
              movement in EEG experiments, the number of channels, and the
              high-pass filter cutoff during preprocessing influence the ICA
              decomposition. We found that for commonly used settings
              (stationary experiment, 64 channels, 0.5 Hz filter), the ICA
              results are acceptable. However, high-pass filters of up to 2 Hz
              cutoff frequency should be used in mobile experiments, and more
              channels require a higher filter to reach an optimal
              decomposition. Fewer brain ICs were found in mobile experiments,
              but cleaning the data with ICA proved to be important and
              functional even with 16 channels. Based on the results, we
              provide guidelines for different experimental settings that

              tools for brain research and clinical management of brain
              disorders. Tremendous effort has been made in solving the inverse
              source imaging problem from EEG/MEG measurements. This is a
              challenging ill-posed problem, since the number of measurements
              is much smaller than the number of possible sources in the brain.
              Various methods have been developed to estimate underlying brain
              sources from noninvasive EEG/MEG as this can offer insight about
              the underlying brain electrical activity with significantly
              improved spatial resolution. In this work, we propose a novel
              data-driven Source Imaging Framework using deep learning neural
              networks (SIFNet), where (1) a simulation pipeline is designed to
              model realistic brain activation and EEG/MEG signals to train
              generalizable neural networks, (2) and a residual convolutional
              neural network is trained using the simulated data, capable of
              estimating source distributions from EEG/MEG recordings. The
              performance of our proposed SIFNet approach is evaluated in a
              series of computer simulations, which indicates the excellent
              performance of SIFNet outperforming conventional weighted minimum
              norm algorithms that were tested in this work. The SIFNet is
              further tested by analyzing interictal EEG data recorded in a
              clinical setting from a focal epilepsy patient. The results of
              this clinical data analysis indicate accurate localization of
              epileptogenic activity as validated by the epileptogenic zone
              clinically determined in this patient. In sum, the proposed
              SIFNet approach promises to offer an alternative solution to the
              EEG/MEG inverse source imaging problem, shows promising signs of
              being robust against measurement noise, and is easy to implement,

               functional neuroimaging in humans for nearly a hundred years.
               Because it is inexpensive, easy to implement, and noninvasive,
               it also represents an excellent candidate modality for use in
               the BCI setting. Nonetheless, a complete understanding of how
               EEG measurements (voltage fluctuations) relate to information
               processing in the brain remains somewhat elusive. A deeper
               understanding of the neuroanatomical underpinnings of the EEG
               signal may help explain inter-individual variability in evoked
               and induced potentials, which may improve BCI therapies targeted
               to the individual. According to classic biophysical models, EEG
               fluctuations are primarily a reflection of locally synchronized
               neuronal oscillations within the gray matter oriented
               approximately orthogonal to the scalp. In contrast, global
               models ignore local signals due to dendritic processing, and
               suggest that propagation delays due to white matter architecture
               are responsible for the EEG signal, and are capable of
               explaining the coherence between numerous rhythms (e.g., alpha)
               at spatially distinct areas of the scalp. Recently, combined
               local-global models suggest that the EEG signal may reflect a
               superposition of local processing along with global contributors
               including transduction along white matter tracts in the brain.
               Incorporating both local and global (e.g., white matter) priors
               into EEG source models may therefore improve source estimates.
               These models may also help disentangle which aspects of the EEG
               signal are predicted to colocalize spatially with measurements
               from functional MRI (fMRI). Here, we explore the possibility

               adaptation tasks on how movements adapted in one context
               generalize to another. We investigated this by manipulating
               subjects' attention to their movements while exposing them to
               split-belt walking (i.e., legs moving at different speeds),
               which is known to induce locomotor adaptation. We hypothesized
               that reducing subjects' attention to their movements by
               distracting them as they adapted their walking pattern would
               facilitate the generalization of recalibrated movements beyond
               the training environment. We reasoned that awareness of the
               novel split-belt condition could be used to consciously
               contextualize movements to that particular situation. To test
               this hypothesis, young adults adapted their gait on a split-belt
               treadmill while they observed visual information that either
               distracted them or made them aware of the belt's speed
               difference. We assessed adaptation and aftereffects of spatial
               and temporal gait features known to adapt and generalize
               differently in different environments. We found that all groups
               adapted similarly by reaching the same steady-state values for
               all gait parameters at the end of the adaptation period. In
               contrast, both groups with altered attention to the split-belts
               environment (distraction and awareness groups) generalized their
               movements from the treadmill to overground more than controls,
               who walked without altered attention. This was specifically
               observed in the generalization of step time (temporal gait
               feature), which might be less susceptible to online corrections
               during walking overground. These results suggest that altering
               attention to one's movements during sensorimotor adaptation
               facilitates the generalization of movement recalibration.NEW \&
               NOTEWORTHY Little is known about how attention affects the
               generalization of motor recalibration induced by sensorimotor
               adaptation paradigms. We showed that altering attention to
               movements on a split-belt treadmill led to greater adaptation

              typical scalp electrical recording in order to improve a fast and
              effective artefact removal approach. Our experiments show that
              correlation coefficient and spectral gradient of brain components
              differ from artefactual components. We trained two binary support
              vector machine classifiers such that one separates brain
              components from muscle components, and the other separates brain
              components from mains power and environmental components. We
              compared the performance of the proposed approach with seven

               enhance perception. This effect is proposed to be mediated by
               novel stimuli activating the amygdala and enhancing early

               leading to short-lived effects on action in the first hundreds
               of milliseconds after presentation. We argue that these effects
               are related to deviance, rather than to novelty per se, and link
               them to activation of the locus-coeruleus norepinephrine system.

  abstract = "Abstract Recent years have witnessed a massive push towards
              reproducible research in neuroscience. Unfortunately, this
              endeavor is often challenged by the large diversity of tools
              used, project-specific custom code and the difficulty to track
              all user-defined parameters. NeuroPycon is an open-source
              multi-modal brain data analysis toolkit which provides
              Python-based template pipelines for advanced multi-processing of
              MEG, EEG, functional and anatomical MRI data, with a focus on
              connectivity and graph theoretical analyses. Importantly, it
              provides shareable parameter files to facilitate replication of
              all analysis steps. NeuroPycon is based on the NiPype framework
              which facilitates data analyses by wrapping many commonly-used
              neuroimaging software tools into a common Python environment. In
              other words, rather than being a brain imaging software with is
              own implementation of standard algorithms for brain signal
              processing, NeuroPycon seamlessly integrates existing packages
              (coded in python, Matlab or other languages) into a unified
              python framework. Importantly, thanks to the multi-threaded
              processing and computational efficiency afforded by NiPype,
              NeuroPycon provides an easy option for fast parallel processing,
              which critical when handling large sets of multi-dimensional
              brain data. Moreover, its flexible design allows users to easily
              configure analysis pipelines by connecting distinct nodes to each
              other. Each node can be a Python-wrapped module, a user-defined
              function or a well-established tool (e.g. MNE-Python for MEG
              analysis, Radatools for graph theoretical metrics, etc.). Last
              but not least, the ability to use NeuroPycon parameter files to
              fully describe any pipeline is an important feature for
              reproducibility, as they can be shared and used for easy
              replication by others. The current implementation of NeuroPycon
              contains two complementary packages: The first, called ephypype,
              includes pipelines for electrophysiology analysis and a
              command-line interface for on the fly pipeline creation. Current
              implementations allow for MEG/EEG data import, pre-processing and
              cleaning by automatic removal of ocular and cardiac artefacts, in
              addition to sensor or source-level connectivity analyses. The
              second package, called graphpype, is designed to investigate
              functional connectivity via a wide range of graph-theoretical
              metrics, including modular partitions. The present article
              describes the philosophy, architecture, and functionalities of
              the toolkit and provides illustrative examples through
              interactive notebooks. NeuroPycon is available for download via
              github (https://github.com/neuropycon) and the two principal
              packages are documented online
              (https://neuropycon.github.io/ephypype/index.html, and
              https://neuropycon.github.io/graphpype/index.html). Future
              developments include fusion of multi-modal data (eg. MEG and fMRI
              or intracranial EEG and fMRI). We hope that the release of
              NeuroPycon will attract many users and new contributors, and
              facilitate the efforts of our community towards open source tool
              sharing and development, as well as scientific reproducibility.",

  abstract = "Analysis of brain connectivity has become an important research
              tool in neuroscience. Connectivity can be estimated between
              cortical sources reconstructed from the electroencephalogram
              (EEG). Such analysis often relies on trial averaging to obtain
              reliable results. However, some applications such as
              brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) require single-trial estimation
              methods. In this paper, we present SCoT-a source connectivity
              toolbox for Python. This toolbox implements routines for blind
              source decomposition and connectivity estimation with the MVARICA
              approach. Additionally, a novel extension called CSPVARICA is
              available for labeled data. SCoT estimates connectivity from
              various spectral measures relying on vector autoregressive (VAR)
              models. Optionally, these VAR models can be regularized to
              facilitate ill posed applications such as single-trial fitting.
              We demonstrate basic usage of SCoT on motor imagery (MI) data.
              Furthermore, we show simulation results of utilizing SCoT for
              feature extraction in a BCI application. These results indicate
              that CSPVARICA and correct regularization can significantly
              improve MI classification. While SCoT was mainly designed for
              application in BCIs, it contains useful tools for other areas of
              neuroscience. SCoT is a software package that (1) brings combined
              source decomposition and connectivtiy estimation to the open
              Python platform, and (2) offers tools for single-trial
              connectivity estimation. The source code is released under the

              uncovered by dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) analysis of

              somatosensory, motor, visual, and multisensory processing
              functions using EEG signals. We applied dFC to the EEG of two

              able-bodied subjects. We quantified the changes due to sensory

              regions involved in sensorimotor processing. The dFC metrics
              reveal that sensory stimulation enhances the speed of information
              transfer (shown by decreases in temporal distance) and number of

              somatosensory, motor, and higher order processing regions in the
              cortex of amputees in response to sensory stimulation. We believe
              that our work provides crucial insights on the cortical impact of
              sensory stimulation in amputees, which may lead to the design of
              personalized brain-informed sensory feedback paradigms. This in

              functional organization; functional segregation and functional
              integration. The integration within and between functionally

              directions of information flow in brain networks from these data
              remains a key challenge. Research over the last few years has
              identified Granger causality as a statistically principled
              technique to furnish this capability. The estimation of Granger
              causality currently requires autoregressive modeling of neural

              used Fourier and wavelet transforms to estimate both pairwise and
              conditional measures of Granger causality, eliminating the need
              of explicit autoregressive data modeling. We demonstrate the
              effectiveness of this approach by applying it to synthetic data
              generated by network models with known connectivity and to local

              is to use measured brain-activity patterns to test computational
              models of brain information processing. One approach to this
              problem is representational similarity analysis (RSA), which
              characterizes a representation in a brain or computational model
              by the distance matrix of the response patterns elicited by a set
              of stimuli. The representational distance matrix encapsulates
              what distinctions between stimuli are emphasized and what
              distinctions are de-emphasized in the representation. A model is
              tested by comparing the representational distance matrix it
              predicts to that of a measured brain region. RSA also enables us
              to compare representations between stages of processing within a
              given brain or model, between brain and behavioral data, and
              between individuals and species. Here, we introduce a Matlab
              toolbox for RSA. The toolbox supports an analysis approach that
              is simultaneously data- and hypothesis-driven. It is designed to
              help integrate a wide range of computational models into the
              analysis of multichannel brain-activity measurements as provided
              by modern functional imaging and neuronal recording techniques.
              Tools for visualization and inference enable the user to relate
              sets of models to sets of brain regions and to statistically test
              and compare the models using nonparametric inference methods. The
              toolbox supports searchlight-based RSA, to continuously map a
              measured brain volume in search of a neuronal population code
              with a specific geometry. Finally, we introduce the
              linear-discriminant t value as a measure of representational
              discriminability that bridges the gap between linear decoding
              analyses and RSA. In order to demonstrate the capabilities of the
              toolbox, we apply it to both simulated and real fMRI data. The
              key functions are equally applicable to other modalities of
              brain-activity measurement. The toolbox is freely available to

              postural perturbation. To evoke proprioceptive postural
              perturbation, vibratory stimulation at 85 Hz was applied to the
              calf muscles of 33 subjects over four 75-second stimulation
              periods. Stimulation was performed according to a pseudorandom
              binary sequence. Vibratory impulses were synchronized to
              high-density electroencephalography (HD-EEG, 256 channels).
              Changes in absolute spectral power (ASP) were analyzed over four
              frequency bands (D: 0.5-3.5 Hz; h: 3.5-7.5 Hz; a: 7.5-12.5 Hz; b:
              12.5-30 Hz). A force platform recorded torque actuated by the
              feet, and normalized sway path length (SPL) was computed as a
              construct for postural performance during each period. SPL values
              indicated improvement in postural performance over the trial
              periods. Significant variation in absolute power values (ASP) was
              found in assessing postural adaptation: an increase in h band ASP
              in the frontal-central region for closed-eyes trials, an increase
              in h and b band ASP in the parietal region for open-eyes trials.
              In habituation, no significant variations in ASP were observed
              during closed-eyes trials, whereas an increase in h, a, and b
              band ASP was observed with open eyes. Furthermore, open-eyed

              habituation, suggesting that following cortical activity during
              postural perturbation may be up-regulated with the availability
              of visual feedback. These results altogether provide deeper
              insight into pathological postural control failure by exploring
              the dynamic changes in both cortical activity and postural

              spatial accuracy and response speed, whereas deactivation of A5
              impaired spatial accuracy, but not response speed. Simulations
              based on optimal feedback control demonstrated that
              'deactivation' of the control policy (reduction of feedback gain)
              impaired both spatial accuracy and response speed, whereas
              'deactivation' in state estimation (reduction of Kalman gain)

              correlates of cognitive processing underpinning step initiation
              by means of movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs) analysis
              and force-plates recordings. Healthy young volunteers (N = 11)
              performed self-paced forward- and backward-oriented steps on two
              force platforms, which were synchronized to simultaneous EEG
              recordings. MRCPs and their source localization analyses were

              processing during step preparation and execution, as showed by
              the prefrontal activity, which was enhanced in backward stepping.
              Further, the parietal activity was larger in forward than
              backward stepping, while motor-related regions were involved in
              both step directions. Thus, the neural timing and sources of
              forward and backward stepping suggest a functional distinction of
              these two actions, which undergo different cortical

              control and can be regarded as an avoidance behavior, while
              forward stepping would be assimilated to an oriented-to-action

              anterior cingulate cortex, a brain area involved in cognitive
              control, which also appears to respond to the occurrence of
              conflict. The present article reports two computational modeling
              studies, serving to articulate the conflict monitoring hypothesis
              and examine its implications. The first study tests the
              sufficiency of the hypothesis to account for brain activation
              data, applying a measure of conflict to existing models of tasks
              shown to engage the anterior cingulate. The second study
              implements a feedback loop connecting conflict monitoring to
              cognitive control, using this to simulate a number of important
              behavioral phenomena.",

               conditions that induce changes in visceral arousal, suggesting
               that ACC supports a generation of integrated bodily responses.
               To clarify the relationship between purely cognitive and

               neural responses to novel events. In Experiment 1, independent
               component analysis of scalp ERP data revealed a common neural
               generator implicated in the generation of both the error-related
               negativity (ERN) and the novelty-related frontocentral N2. In

               course and outcome of an action violates expectancies (not
               necessarily related to reward), the aMCC seems to be engaged in

  abstract = "Objective: Short intracortical inhibition (SICI) is a
              GABAA-mediated phenomenon, argued to mediate selective muscle
              activation during coordinated motor activity. Markedly reduced
              SICI has been observed in the acute period following stroke and,
              based on findings in animal models, it has been posited this
              disinhibitory phenomenon may facilitate neural plasticity and
              contribute to early motor recovery. However, it remains
              unresolved whether SICI normalizes over time, as part of the
              natural course of stroke recovery. Whether intracortical
              inhibition contributes to motor recovery in chronic stroke also
              remains unclear. Notably, SICI is typically measured at rest,
              which may not fully reveal its role in motor control. Here we
              investigated SICI at rest and during voluntary motor activity to
              determine: (1) whether GABAA-mediated inhibition recovers, and
              (2) how GABAA-mediated inhibition is related to motor function,
              in the chronic phase post-stroke. Methods: We studied 16 chronic
              stroke survivors (age: 64.6 $\pm$ 9.3 years; chronicity: 74.3
              $\pm$ 52.9 months) and 12 age-matched healthy controls. We used
              paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to induce
              SICI during three conditions: rest, submaximal grip, and
              performance of box-and-blocks. Upper-extremity Fugl-Meyer
              Assessment and Box-and-Blocks tests were used to evaluate motor
              impairment in stroke survivors and manual dexterity in all
              participants, respectively. Results: At rest, SICI revealed no
              differences between ipsilesional and contralesional hemispheres
              of either cortical or subcortical stroke survivors, or healthy
              controls (P's > 0.05). During box-and-blocks, however,
              ipsilesional hemisphere SICI was significantly reduced (P =
              0.025), especially following cortical stroke (P < 0.001). SICI in
              the ipsilesional hemisphere during box-and-blocks task was
              significantly related to paretic hand dexterity (r = 0.56, P =
              0.039) and motor impairment (r = 0.56, P = 0.037). Conclusions:
              SICI during motor activity, but not rest, reveals persistent
              impairment in chronic stroke survivors indicating that inhibitory
              brain circuits responsible for motor coordination do not fully
              normalize as part of the natural history of stroke recovery.
              Observation that reduced SICI (i.e., disinhibition) is associated
              with greater motor impairment and worse dexterity in chronic
              hemiparetic individuals suggests the response considered to
              promote neuroplasticity and recovery in the acute phase could be
              maladaptive in the chronic phase post-stroke.",

               extract from muscles recordings the latency of feedback
               adaptation. Our results confirmed that participants adapted
               their feedback responses to unanticipated force fields applied
               randomly. In addition, our analyses revealed that the feedback
               response was specifically and finely tuned to the ongoing
               perturbation not only across trials with the same force field,
               but also across different kinds of force fields. Finally,
               changes in muscle activity consistent with feedback adaptation
               occurred in about 250ms following reach onset. The adaptation
               that we observed across trials presented in a random context was
               similar to the one observed when the force fields could be
               anticipated, suggesting that these two adaptive processes may be
               closely linked to each other. In such case, our measurement of
               250ms may correspond to the latency of motor adaptation in the
               nervous system.Significance Statement We measure the latency of
               feedback adaptation in a human reaching experiment by applying
               force field trials randomly. In spite of the fact that these
               disturbances could not be anticipated, we measured improvement
               in feedback corrections that paralleled standard adaptation.
               Correlates in muscle recordings occurred within about 250ms
               following movement onset. Such a short timescale of adaptation
               suggested that rapid adaptation complements feedback control of
               an ongoing movement. To further test this hypothesis, we
               demonstrate that indeed participants are able to adapt their
               feedback responses to different kinds of force fields and
               directions applied randomly. These findings support the
               existence of very rapid, possibly online, adaptation in the
               nervous system.",

              restoring channels utilize different interpolation strategies by
              taking averages of neighboring electrodes or fitting surfaces to
              the electrodes. These techniques usually perform better for
              higher electrode densities and values interpolated at areas far
              from electrodes can be unreliable. Using a method that instead
              learns the statistical distribution of the cortical electrical
              fields and predicts values of missing electrodes may yield better
              results. Generative networks based on convolutional layers were
              trained to upsample from 4 or 14 channels or restore single
              missing channels to recreate 21 channel EEGs. Roughly 5,144 hours
              of data from 1,385 subjects of the Temple University Hospital EEG
              data Corpus were used for training and evaluating the networks.
              The results were compared to interpolation by spherical splines
              and a visual evaluation by board certified clinical
              neurophysiologists was conducted. In addition, the effect on
              performance due to the number of subjects used for training was
              evaluated. The generative networks performed significantly better
              overall compared to spherical spline interpolation. There was no
              difference between real and network generated data in the number
              of examples assessed as fake by experienced EEG interpreters. On
              the contrary, the number was significantly higher for data

              increasing number of included subjects, with the greatest effect

              performance without any concomitant improvement in learning. We

              a new gait pattern using sensory prediction errors detected by
              proprioceptive feedback. When we also provided visual error
              feedback, participants acquired the new walking pattern far more
              rapidly and showed accelerated restoration of the normal walking
              pattern during washout. However, when the visual error feedback
              was removed during either learning or washout, errors reappeared
              with performance immediately returning to the level expected
              based on proprioceptive learning alone. These findings support a
              model with two mechanisms: a dual-rate adaptation process that
              learns invariantly from sensory prediction error detected by
              proprioception and a visual-feedback-dependent process that

               effort is quantified with a cost function. While the rewards can

               constant and characterize how the nervous system organizes motor

  abstract = "Learning a skilled movement often requires changing multiple
              dimensions of movement in a coordinated manner. Serial training
              is one common approach to learning a new movement pattern, where
              each feature is learned in isolation from the others. Once one
              feature is learned, we move on to the next. However, when
              learning a complex movement pattern, serial training is not only
              laborious but can also be ineffective. Often, movement features
              are linked such that they cannot simply be added together as we
              progress through training. Thus, the ability to learn multiple
              features in parallel could make training faster and more

  abstract = "When we use a novel tool, the motor commands may not produce the
              expected outcome. In healthy individuals, with practice the brain
              learns to alter the motor commands. This change depends
              critically on the cerebellum as damage to this structure impairs
              adaptation. However, it is unclear precisely what the cerebellum
              contributes to the process of adaptation in human motor learning.
              Is the cerebellum crucial for learning to associate motor
              commands with novel sensory consequences, called forward model,
              or is the cerebellum important for learning to associate sensory
              goals with novel motor commands, called inverse model? Here, we
              compared performance of cerebellar patients and healthy controls
              in a reaching task with a gradual perturbation schedule. This
              schedule allowed both groups to adapt their motor commands.
              Following training, we measured two kinds of behavior: in one
              case, people were presented with reach targets near the direction
              in which they had trained. The resulting generalization patterns
              of patients and controls were similar, suggesting comparable
              inverse models. In the second case, participants reached without
              a target and reported the location of their hand. In controls,
              the pattern of change in reported hand location was consistent
              with simulation results of a forward model that had learned to
              associate motor commands with new sensory consequences. In
              patients, this change was significantly smaller. Therefore, in
              our sample of patients, we observed that while adaptation of
              motor commands can take place despite cerebellar damage,
              cerebellar integrity appears critical for learning to predict
              visual sensory consequences of motor commands.",

               length aftereffects during overground gait after two
               rehabilitation intervention strategies to combat step length
               asymmetry: split-belt treadmill (SBT) walking and unilateral
               stepping. METHODS: Eighteen healthy young adults (22 $\pm$ 3 yr)
               first performed 10 overground gait trials. Participants then
               walked for 10 min under three different treadmill conditions in
               a randomized order: SBT walking, slow unilateral stepping, and
               fast unilateral stepping. Immediately after each treadmill
               condition, participants performed ten overground gait trials.
               Mean step length asymmetry was calculated across the first five
               strides of the overground gait trials to assess the storage of
               aftereffects after each treadmill condition. We also explored
               the lower extremity kinematics during each treadmill condition
               to investigate movement patterns that lead to greatest
               aftereffects. RESULTS: Significantly higher step length
               asymmetry was observed in overground gait trials after SBT
               walking compared to those after slow and fast unilateral
               stepping, indicating greater aftereffect/carryover of the SBT
               walking pattern to overground gait. During fast unilateral
               stepping, increased flexion in the hip, knee, and ankle of the
               stationary limb was significantly associated with increased step
               length aftereffects. CONCLUSIONS: The aftereffects observed
               after acute SBT walking were significantly greater than those
               after unilateral stepping. Both exercises induce aftereffects of
               similar kinematic patterns, although likely through different
               mechanisms. In sum, SBT walking induces the greatest
               aftereffects, although unilateral stepping also induces a change
               in gait behavior. During unilateral stepping, the largest
               aftereffects occur when the walker does not simply fully extend
               the stationary limb and allow the treadmill to passively move
               the stepping limb during stance.",

               and visual feedback can be used during gait rehabilitation to
               develop effective gait training. We have previously shown that
               subjects can adapt spatial aspects of walking to an implicitly
               imposed distortion of visual feedback of step length. To further
               investigate the storage benefit of an implicit process engaged
               in visual feedback distortion, we compared the robustness of
               aftereffects acquired by visual feedback distortion, versus
               split-belt treadmill walking. For the visual distortion trial,
               we implicitly distorted the visual representation of subjects'
               gait symmetry, whereas for the split-belt trial, the speed ratio
               of the two belts was gradually adjusted without visual feedback.
               After adaptation, the visual feedback or the split-belt
               perturbation was removed while subjects continued walking, and
               aftereffects of preserved asymmetric pattern were assessed. We
               found that subjects trained with visual distortion trial
               retained aftereffects longest. In response to the larger speed
               ratio of split-belt walking, the subjects showed an increase in
               the size of aftereffects compared to the smaller speed ratio,
               but it steeply decreased over time in all the speed ratios

               change in motor strategy and implicit process in sensorimotor
               adaptation. Although it should be clarified more clearly through
               further studies, the findings of this study suggest that gait
               control employs distinct adaptive processes during the visual
               distortion and split-belt walking and also the level of reliance
               of an implicit process may be greater in the visual distortion

               binary feedback about success and failure in the absence of
               vector error feedback. We examined the time course of decay

               error-clamp condition---trials in which subjects received false
               visual feedback showing perfect directional performance,
               regardless of the movements they actually made. Exposure to this
               error-clamp following initial visuomotor adaptation led to a
               rapid reversion to baseline behavior. In contrast, exposure to
               binary feedback after initial adaptation turned the adapted
               state into a new baseline, to which subjects reverted after
               transient exposure to another visuomotor rotation. When both

               exhibited rapid decay to the original baseline, while others

               fast-forgetting adaptation process that is sensitive to vector
               errors and insensitive to task success, and a second process

              task. Specifically, they were told the exact nature of the
              directional perturbation, a rotation that directed them 45
              degrees counterclockwise from the desired target, and they were
              instructed to counter it by aiming for the neighboring clockwise
              target, 45 degrees away. Subjects were initially successful in
              completely negating the rotation with this strategy.
              Surprisingly, however, they were unable to sustain explicit
              control and made increasingly large errors to the desired target.
              The cognitive strategy failed because subjects simultaneously
              adapted unconsciously to the rotation to the neighboring target.
              Notably, the rate of implicit adaptation to the neighboring
              target was not significantly different from rotation adaptation
              in the absence of an opposing explicit strategy. These results
              indicate that explicit strategies cannot substitute for implicit
              adaptation to a visuomotor rotation and are in fact overridden by
              the motor planning system. This suggests that the motor system
              requires that planned and executed trajectories remain congruous
              in visual space, and enforces this correspondence even at the
              expense of an opposing explicit task goal.",

  abstract = "A child often learns to ride a bicycle in the driveway, free of
              unforeseen obstacles. Yet when she first rides in the street, we
              hope that if a car suddenly pulls out in front of her, she will
              combine her innate goal of avoiding an accident with her learned
              knowledge of the bicycle, and steer away or brake. In general,
              when we train to perform a new motor task, our learning is most
              robust if it updates the rules of online error correction to
              reflect the rules and goals of the new task. Here we provide
              direct evidence that, after a new feedforward motor adaptation,
              motor feedback responses to unanticipated errors become precisely
              task appropriate, even when such errors were never experienced
              during training. To study this ability, we asked how, if at all,
              do online responses to occasional, unanticipated force pulses
              during reaching arm movements change after adapting to altered
              arm dynamics? Specifically, do they change in a task-appropriate
              manner? In our task, subjects learned novel velocity-dependent
              dynamics. However, occasional force-pulse perturbations produced
              unanticipated changes in velocity. Therefore, after adaptation,
              task-appropriate responses to unanticipated pulses should
              compensate corresponding changes in velocity-dependent dynamics.
              We found that after adaptation, pulse responses precisely
              compensated these changes, although they were never trained to do
              so. These results provide evidence for a smart feedback
              controller which automatically produces responses specific to the
              learned dynamics of the current task. To accomplish this, the
              neural processes underlying feedback control must (1) be capable
              of accurate real-time state prediction for velocity via a forward
              model and (2) have access to recently learned changes in internal
              models of limb dynamics.",

  abstract = "Recent work has shown that, when countering external forces, the
              nervous system adjusts not only predictive (i.e., feedforward)
              control of reaching but also reflex (i.e., feedback) responses to
              mechanical perturbations. Here we show that altering the physical
              properties of the arm (i.e., intersegmental dynamics) causes the
              nervous system to adjust feedforward control and that this
              learning transfers to feedback responses even though the latter
              were never directly trained. Forty-five human participants (30
              females) performed a single-joint elbow reaching task and
              countered mechanical perturbations that created pure elbow
              motion. In our first experiment, we altered intersegmental
              dynamics by asking participants to generate pure elbow movements
              when the shoulder joint was either free to rotate or locked by
              the robotic manipulandum. With the shoulder unlocked, we found
              robust activation of shoulder flexor muscles for pure elbow
              flexion trials, as required to counter the interaction torques
              that arise at the shoulder because of forearm rotation. After
              locking the shoulder joint, which cancels these interaction
              torques, we found a substantial reduction in shoulder muscle
              activity over many trials. In our second experiment, we tested
              whether such learning transfers to feedback control. Mechanical
              perturbations applied to the arm with the shoulder unlocked
              revealed that feedback responses also account for intersegmental

              appropriate for the altered intersegmental dynamics. Our work

              stable over time, at least in the absence of error feedback. Here

              recent experience shapes the statistical properties of reaching,

              movements are made to targets near a particular location
              subsequent movements to that location become less variable, but
              at the cost of increased bias for reaches to other targets. This
              process exhibits the variance-bias tradeoff that is a hallmark of
              Bayesian estimation. We provide evidence that this process
              reflects a fast, trial-by-trial learning of the prior

              patterns that can adapt to changes in our bodies or environment
              and also take advantage of assistance provided by the
              environment. We ask how energy minimization influences adaptive
              learning during human locomotion to improve economy when walking
              on a split-belt treadmill. We use a model-based approach to
              predict how people should adjust their walking pattern to take
              advantage of the assistance provided by the treadmill, and we
              validate these predictions empirically. We show that adaptation
              to a split-belt treadmill can be explained as a process by which
              people reduce step length asymmetry to take advantage of the work
              performed by the treadmill to reduce metabolic cost. Our results
              also have implications for the evaluation of devices designed to
              reduce effort during walking, as locomotor adaptation may serve
              as a model approach to understand how people learn to take
              advantage of external assistance. ABSTRACT: In everyday tasks
              such as walking and running, we often exploit the work performed
              by external sources to reduce effort. Recent research has focused
              on designing assistive devices capable of performing mechanical
              work to reduce the work performed by muscles and improve walking
              function. The success of these devices relies on the user
              learning to take advantage of this external assistance. Although
              adaptation is central to this process, the study of adaptation is
              often done using approaches that seem to have little in common
              with the use of external assistance. We show in 16 young, healthy
              participants that a common approach for studying adaptation,
              split-belt treadmill walking, can be understood from a
              perspective in which people learn to take advantage of mechanical
              work performed by the treadmill. Initially, during split-belt
              walking, people step further forward on the slow belt than the
              fast belt which we measure as a negative step length asymmetry,
              but this asymmetry is reduced with practice. We demonstrate that
              reductions in asymmetry allow people to extract positive work
              from the treadmill, reduce the positive work performed by the
              legs, and reduce metabolic cost. We also show that walking with
              positive step length asymmetries, defined by longer steps on the
              fast belt, minimizes metabolic cost, and people choose this
              pattern after guided experience of a wide range of asymmetries.

              simultaneously disrupt metabolic cost and an alternate acute task

              whether the PWS could be explained on the basis of either

              landscape. Healthy adults (N = 21) walked on an instrumented
              treadmill under normal conditions and, while negotiating a
              continuous gait perturbation, imposed leg-length asymmetry.
              Oxygen consumption, motion capture data and ground reaction
              forces were continuously recorded for each condition at speeds
              ranging from 0.6 to 1.8 m s-1, including the PWS. Both metabolic
              and speed regulation measures were disrupted by the perturbation
              (p < 0.05). Perturbed PWS selection did not exhibit energetic
              prioritization (although we find some indication of energy
              minimization after motor adaptation). Similarly, PWS selection
              did not support prioritization of speed error regulation, which
              was found to be independent of speed in both conditions. It
              appears that, during acute exposure to a mechanical gait
              perturbation of imposed leg-length asymmetry, humans minimize
              neither energetic cost nor speed regulation errors. Despite the
              abundance of evidence pointing to energy minimization during
              normal, steady-state gait, this may not extend acutely to
              perturbed gait. Understanding how the nervous system acutely
              controls gait perturbations requires further research that
              embraces multi-objective control paradigms.",

              cost in walking. The system applies controlled fore-aft forces to

              pulling forward, or increasing it by pulling backward. The system
              controls the forces, and thus energetic cost as a function of how
              the user is moving. In testing, we found that the system can
              quickly, accurately, and precisely apply target forces within a
              walking step. We next controlled the forces as a function of the

  abstract = "The theory that the sensorimotor system minimizes energetic cost
              during locomotion has long been supported by both computational
              models and empirical studies. However, it has yet to be
              determined if the behavior to which people converge when exposed
              to a novel perturbation during locomotion is also energetically
              optimal. We address this issue in the context of adaptation to
              walking on a split-belt treadmill, which can impose a left-right
              asymmetry in step lengths. In response to this asymmetry,
              participants gradually adjust their foot placement to adopt steps
              of equal length. Here, we characterized metabolic, mechanical,

              energetically optimal strategy for walking on a split-belt

              treadmill walking, in which each foot is placed on a belt moving
              at a different speed. As subjects adapt to split-belt walking,
              they reduce metabolic power, but the biomechanical mechanism
              behind this improved efficiency is unknown. Analyzing mechanical
              work performed by the legs and joints during split-belt
              adaptation could reveal this mechanism. Because ankle work in the
              step-to-step transition is more efficient than hip work, we
              hypothesized that control subjects would reduce hip work on the
              fast belt and increase ankle work during the step-to-step
              transition as they adapted. We further hypothesized that subjects
              with unilateral, trans-tibial amputation would instead increase
              propulsive work from their intact leg on the slow belt. Control
              subjects reduced hip work and shifted more ankle work to the
              step-to-step transition, supporting our hypothesis. Contrary to
              our second hypothesis, intact leg work, ankle work and hip work
              in amputees were unchanged during adaptation. Furthermore, all
              subjects increased collisional energy loss on the fast belt, but
              did not increase propulsive work. This was possible because
              subjects moved further backward during fast leg single support in
              late adaptation than in early adaptation, compensating by
              reducing backward movement in slow leg single support. In
              summary, subjects used two strategies to improve mechanical
              efficiency in split-belt walking adaptation: a CoM displacement
              strategy that allows for less forward propulsion on the fast
              belt; and, an ankle timing strategy that allows efficient ankle
              work in the step-to-step transition to increase while reducing
              inefficient hip work.",

               decreased mobility, yet individuals with chronic stroke often
               self-select an asymmetric gait despite being capable of walking
               more symmetrically. The purpose of this study was to test
               whether self-selected asymmetry could be explained by energy
               cost minimization. We hypothesized that short-term deviations
               from self-selected asymmetry would result in increased metabolic
               energy consumption, despite being associated with long-term
               rehabilitation benefits. Other studies have found no difference
               in metabolic rate across different levels of enforced asymmetry
               among individuals with chronic stroke, but used methods that
               left some uncertainty to be resolved. Methods: In this study,
               ten individuals with chronic stroke walked on a treadmill at
               participant-specific speeds while voluntarily modulating step
               length asymmetry. We included only participants with significant
               self-selected asymmetry who were able to significantly alter
               asymmetry using visual biofeedback. Conditions included
               targeting zero asymmetry, self-selected asymmetry, and double
               the self-selected asymmetry. Participants were trained with the
               biofeedback system in one session, and data were collected in
               three subsequent sessions with repeated measures. Self-selected
               asymmetry was consistent across sessions. A similar protocol was
               conducted among unimpaired participants. Results: Participants
               with chronic stroke substantially altered step length asymmetry
               using biofeedback, but this did not affect metabolic rate
               (ANOVA, p = 0.8). In unimpaired participants, self-selected step
               length asymmetry was close to zero and corresponded to the
               lowest energy cost (ANOVA, p = 6e-4). While the symmetry of
               unimpaired gait may be the result of energy cost minimization,
               self-selected step length asymmetry in individuals with chronic
               stroke cannot be explained by a similar least-effort drive.
               Conclusions: Interventions that encourage changes in step length
               asymmetry by manipulating metabolic energy consumption may be
               effective because these therapies would not have to overcome a
               metabolic penalty for altering asymmetry. \#\#\# Competing

              energy expenditure during walking, because they differ from the
              nominal preferred gait, which is typically the most economical,
              and because of the cost of making active feedback adjustments to
              maintain gait stability. We tested this hypothesis by
              artificially inducing greater step variability through visual
              perturbations from a virtual reality display, and measuring the
              effect on energy expenditure. Young healthy adult subjects (N=11)
              walked on a treadmill while viewing a virtual hallway, to which
              virtual perturbations were applied in fore-aft or medio-lateral
              directions. The greatest effect on gait was achieved with
              medio-lateral visual perturbations, which resulted in a 65\%
              increase in step width variability and a 5.9\% increase (both
              P<0.05) in net metabolic rate compared to walking without
              perturbations. Perturbations generally induced greater
              variability in both step width and (to a lesser degree) step
              length, and also induced slightly wider and (to a lesser degree)
              shorter mean steps. Each of these measures was found to correlate
              significantly with each other, regardless of perturbation
              direction and magnitude. They also correlated with metabolic rate
              (P<0.05 for each separate measure), despite explaining only a

              perturbing balance while the walking movement is preserved. Nine
              healthy subjects walked three times at comfortable walking speed

              unconstrained walking. In the next two trials, subject walked
              while following a step pattern projected on the treadmill. The
              steps projected were either composed of the averaged step
              characteristics (periodic trial), or were an exact copy including
              the variability of the steps taken while walking unconstrained
              (variable trial). Metabolic energy cost was assessed and center
              of pressure profiles were analyzed to determine task performance,
              and to gain insight into the balance control strategies applied.
              Results showed that the metabolic energy cost was significantly
              higher in both the periodic and variable trial (8\% and 13\%,
              respectively) compared to unconstrained walking. The variation in
              center of pressure trajectories during single limb support was
              higher when a gait pattern was enforced, indicating a more active

              proper foot placement and a more active ankle strategy to control

  abstract = "Combining EEG with eye-tracking is a promising approach to study
              neural correlates of natural vision, but the resulting recordings
              are also heavily contaminated by activity of the eye balls, eye
              lids, and extraocular muscles. While Independent Component
              Analysis (ICA) is commonly used to suppress these ocular
              artifacts, its performance under free viewing conditions has not
              been systematically evaluated and many published reports contain
              residual artifacts. Here I evaluated and optimized ICA-based
              correction for two tasks with unconstrained eye movements: visual
              search in images and sentence reading. In a first step, four
              parameters of the ICA pipeline were varied orthogonally: the (1)
              high-pass and (2) low-pass filter applied to the training data,
              (3) the proportion of training data containing myogenic saccadic
              spike potentials (SP), and (4) the threshold for eye
              tracker-based component rejection. In a second step, the
              eye-tracker was used to objectively quantify the correction
              quality of each ICA solution, both in terms of undercorrection
              (residual artifacts) and overcorrection (removal of neurogenic
              activity). As a benchmark, results were compared to those
              obtained with an alternative spatial filter, Multiple Source Eye
              Correction (MSEC). With commonly used settings, Infomax ICA not
              only left artifacts in the data, but also distorted neurogenic
              activity during eye movement-free intervals. However, correction
              results could be strongly improved by training the ICA on
              optimally filtered data in which SPs were massively overweighted.
              With optimized procedures, ICA removed virtually all artifacts,
              including the SP and its associated spectral broadband artifact
              from both viewing paradigms, with little distortion of neural
              activity. It also outperformed MSEC in terms of SP correction.

              functional integration of several motor cortical areas, such as
              the primary motor cortex, and the spinal circuitries.
              Surprisingly, after almost 40 years of research, how the motor
              cortices specify descending neural signals destined for the
              downstream interneurons and motoneurons has remained elusive. In
              light of the many recent experimental demonstrations that the
              motor system may coordinate muscle activations through a linear
              combination of muscle synergies, we hypothesize that the motor
              cortices may function to select and activate fixed muscle
              synergies specified by the spinal or brainstem networks. To test
              this hypothesis, we recorded electromyograms (EMGs) from 12-16
              upper arm and shoulder muscles from both the unaffected and the
              stroke-affected arms of stroke patients having moderate-to-severe
              unilateral ischemic lesions in the frontal motor cortical areas.
              Analyses of EMGs using a nonnegative matrix factorization
              algorithm revealed that in seven of eight patients the muscular
              compositions of the synergies for both the unaffected and the
              affected arms were strikingly similar to each other despite
              differences in motor performance between the arms, and
              differences in cerebral lesion sizes and locations between
              patients. This robustness of muscle synergies that we observed
              supports the notion that descending cortical signals represent
              neuronal drives that select, activate, and flexibly combine
              muscle synergies specified by networks in the spinal cord and/or
              brainstem. Our conclusion also suggests an approach to stroke
              rehabilitation by focusing on those synergies with altered
              activations after stroke.",

               key issue is the selection of the number of synergies (i.e.,
               model order) to retain. In this preliminary work a set of
               criteria, based on Independent Component Analysis, was developed
               to determine the number of synergies to extract from a
               multivariate EMG dataset, and applied on EMG signals acquired
               from 12 leg muscles during walking at different cadences (40,
               60, ..., 140 strides per minute) in young and elderly subjects.
               The method was tested on ad-hoc created datasets with a
               predetermined number of embedded sources and amplitude of added
               noise. Young subjects walking patterns are explained by a number
               of synergies not significantly different with respect to elderly
               subjects. The inter-subject variability is greater at high
               (elderly) and low (young and elderly) cadences suggesting that
               the walking pattern is more stable at central frequencies. The
               type of preprocessing influences the number of underlying
               synergies: an increased number of independent components is
               needed to explain the variability of unfiltered data. The
               proposed method could serve as a guideline to scientists in the
               evaluation of walking performance. Further developments will

              Recent behavioral studies suggest that sensorimotor savings, or
              faster relearning on second exposure to a task, are due to recall
              of these early, strategic components of adaptation. In the

              stimulation to right or left prefrontal cortex or left motor
              cortex. We found that all groups adapted dart throwing movements
              while wearing prism lenses at the same rate as subjects receiving
              sham stimulation on day 1 On test day 2, which was conducted a
              few days later, the right prefrontal and left motor cortex groups

              greater difference between day 1 and day 2 errors, compared with

  abstract  = "Handedness is a pronounced feature of human motor behavior, yet
               the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesize
               that motor lateralization results from asymmetries in predictive
               control of task dynamics and in control of limb impedance. To
               test this hypothesis, we present an experiment with two
               different force field environments, a field with a predictable
               magnitude that varies with the square of velocity, and a field
               with a less predictable magnitude that varies linearly with
               velocity. These fields were designed to be compatible with
               controllers that are specialized in predicting limb and task
               dynamics, and modulating position and velocity dependent
               impedance, respectively. Because the velocity square field does
               not change the form of the equations of motion for the reaching
               arm, we reasoned that a forward dynamic-type controller should
               perform well in this field, while control of linear damping and
               stiffness terms should be less effective. In contrast, the
               unpredictable linear field should be most compatible with
               impedance control, but incompatible with predictive dynamics
               control. We measured steady state final position accuracy and 3
               trajectory features during exposure to these fields: Mean
               squared jerk, Straightness, and Movement time. Our results
               confirmed that each arm made straighter, smoother, and quicker
               movements in its compatible field. Both arms showed similar
               final position accuracies, which were achieved using more
               extensive corrective sub-movements when either arm performed in
               its incompatible field. Finally, each arm showed limited
               adaptation to its incompatible field. Analysis of the dependence
               of trajectory errors on field magnitude suggested that dominant
               arm adaptation occurred by prediction of the mean field, thus
               exploiting predictive mechanisms for adaptation to the
               unpredictable field. Overall, our results support the hypothesis
               that motor lateralization reflects asymmetries in specific motor
               control mechanisms associated with predictive control of limb
               and task dynamics, and modulation of limb impedance.",

              stroke, motor impairment occurs both contralateral, as well as
              ipsilateral, to the lesion. Although ipsilesional impairments can
              be functionally limiting, they can also provide important insight
              into the role of the ipsilateral hemisphere in controlling
              movement and the lateralization of specific motor control
              mechanisms, given that unilateral arm movements are thought to
              recruit processes in each hemisphere. The purpose of this study
              was to examine whether left and right hemisphere damage following
              stroke produces different ipsilesional deficits, and whether our
              dynamic dominance model of motor lateralization can predict such
              deficits. Specifically, the dynamic dominance model attributes
              control of multijoint dynamics to the left hemisphere, and
              control of steady-state position to the right hemisphere. Chronic
              stroke patients with either left or right hemisphere damage (LHD
              or RHD) used their ipsilesional arm, and the control subjects
              used either their left or right arm (LHC or RHC), to perform
              targeted reaching movements in different directions within the
              workspace ipsilateral to their reaching arm. We found that the
              LHD group showed deficits in controlling the arm's trajectory due
              to impaired multijoint coordination, but no deficits in achieving
              accurate final positions. In contrast, the RHD group showed

              coordinate multiple joints during movement, thereby providing
              additional evidence for the hemisphere-specific nature of motor
              deficits. Furthermore, while both the LHD and RHD groups were
              functionally impaired to the same degree on the Jebsen Hand
              Function Test (JHFT), our results suggest that the underlying

              modulated based on online sensory feedback from other limbs is
              still unknown. We tested this using a bimanual postural control
              task, in which the two hands either controlled two separate
              cursors (double-cursor task) or a single cursor displayed at the
              spatial average between the hands (single-cursor task). In the
              first experiment, the two hands were symmetrically perturbed
              outwards. In the double-cursor task, the participants therefore
              had to return their hands to the targets, whereas in the
              single-cursor task no correction was necessary. Within 50 ms, the
              electromyographic activity showed significantly smaller responses
              in the single- compared with the double-cursor task. In the
              second experiment, the perturbation direction of the left hand

              that the behavior of the right arm in the one-cursor task
              depended on online feedback coming from the left arm: the
              muscular response was modulated within 75 ms based on
              directionally specific information of the left arm. These results

  author   = "Chaumon, Maximilien and Bishop, Dorothy V M and Busch, Niko A",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Electroencephalographic data are easily contaminated
              by signals of non-neural origin. Independent component analysis
              (ICA) can help correct EEG data for such artifacts. Artifact
              independent components (ICs) can be identified by experts via
              visual inspection. But artifact features are sometimes ambiguous
              or difficult to notice, and even experts may disagree about how
              to categorise a particular component. It is therefore important
              to inform users on artifact properties, and give them the
              opportunity to intervene. NEW METHOD: Here we first describe
              artifacts captured by ICA. We review current methods to
              automatically select artifactual components for rejection, and
              introduce the SASICA software, implementing several novel
              selection algorithms as well as two previously described
              automated methods (ADJUST, Mognon et al. Psychophysiology
              2011;48(2):229; and FASTER, Nolan et al. J Neurosci Methods
              2010;48(1):152). RESULTS: We evaluate these algorithms by
              comparing selections suggested by SASICA and other methods to
              manual rejections by experts. The results show that these methods
              can inform observers to improve rejections. However, no automated
              method can accurately isolate artifacts without supervision. The
              comprehensive and interactive plots produced by SASICA therefore
              constitute a helpful guide for human users for making final
              decisions. CONCLUSIONS: Rejecting ICs before EEG data analysis
              unavoidably requires some level of supervision. SASICA offers
              observers detailed information to guide selection of artifact
              ICs. Because it uses quantitative parameters and thresholds, it
              improves objectivity and reproducibility in reporting
              pre-processing procedures. SASICA is also a didactic tool that
              allows users to quickly understand what signal features captured
              by ICs make them likely to reflect artifacts.",

               Electroencephalography (EEG), with motion data as participants

              adapted in minutes) using a split-belt treadmill that controls
              the speed of each leg independently. This leads to storage of a
              modified spatial and temporal motor pattern that is expressed as
              an aftereffect in regular walking conditions. Because split-belt
              walking is a novel task for adults and children alike, we used it
              to investigate how motor adaptation matures during human
              development. We also asked whether the immature pattern resembles
              that of people with cerebellar dysfunction, because we know that
              this adaptation depends on cerebellar integrity. Healthy children
              (3-18 years old) and adults, and individuals with cerebellar
              damage were adapted while walking on split belts (1:2 speed
              ratio). Adaptation and de-adaptation rates were quantified
              separately for temporal and spatial parameters. All healthy
              children and adults tested could learn the new timing at the same
              rate and showed significant aftereffects. However, children
              younger than 6 years old were unable to learn the new spatial
              coordination. Furthermore, children as old as age 11 years old
              showed slower rates of adaptation and de-adaptation of spatial
              parameters of walking. Young children showed patterns similar to
              cerebellar patients, with greater deficits in spatial versus
              temporal adaptation. Thus, although walking is a well-practiced,
              refined motor skill by late childhood (i.e., 11 years of age),
              the processes underlying learning new spatial relationships
              between the legs are still developing. The maturation of
              locomotor adaptation follows at least two time courses, which we
              propose is determined by the developmental state of the
              cerebellum.",

              a split-belt treadmill at symmetric speeds of 4 and 6 km/h for 2
              min. An asymmetric condition was then performed for 10 min in
              which treadmill speeds for the dominant (fast) and nondominant
              (slow) sides were 6 and 4 km/h, respectively. This was
              immediately followed by a symmetric speed condition of 4 km/h for
              5 min. Gait kinematics and ground reaction forces were recorded.
              Electromyography (EMG) was collected from 12 lower limb muscles

              The degree of adaptation and de-adaptation was compared with
              those in walking by calculating the antero-posterior component of
              the ground reaction force (GRF). Adaptation to walking and

              the two components of the GRF showed different behaviors
              depending on the gaits. The anterior braking component showed
              prominent adaptive and de-adaptive behaviors in both gaits. The

  abstract = "When walking on a split-belt treadmill where one belt moves
              faster than the other, the nervous system consistently attempts
              to maintain symmetry between legs, quantified as deviation from
              double support time or step length symmetry. It is known that the
              cerebellum plays a critical role in locomotor adaptation. Less is
              known about the role of corticospinal drive in maintaining this
              type of proprioceptive-driven locomotor adaptation. The objective

              during split-belt walking adaptation. Eighteen healthy

              frequencies. Our results showed that 1) beta- and gamma-band
              coherence (markers of corticospinal drive) increased during early
              split-belt walking compared with baseline walking in the slow
              leg, 2) beta-band coherence decreased from early to late
              split-belt adaptation in the fast leg, 3) alpha-, beta-, and
              gamma-band coherence decreased from first to third split-belt
              exposure in the fast leg, and 4) there was a relationship between
              higher beta coherence in the slow leg TA and smaller double
              support asymmetry. Our results suggest that corticospinal drive
              may play a functional role in the temporal control of split-belt

              offered in all possible combinations for the left and right leg.
              Subjects adapted automatically to a difference in belt speed
              within 10-20 stride cycles. This adaptation was achieved by a
              reorganization of the stride cycle with a relative shortening of
              the duration of the support and lengthening of the swing phase of
              the ``fast'' leg and, vice versa, in support and swing duration
              on the ``slow'' leg. The electromyogram EMG patterns were
              characterized by two basic observations: (1) onset and timing of
              EMG activity were influenced by biomechanical constraints. A
              shortening of the support phase on the faster side was related to
              an earlier onset and increase in gastrocnemius activity, while a
              coactivation pattern in the antagonistic leg muscles was
              predominant during a prolonged support phase on the slower side.
              (2) A differential modulation of the antagonistic leg muscles
              took place. An increase in ipsilateral belt speed in combination
              with a constant contralateral belt speed was associated with an
              almost linear increase in ipsilateral gastrocnemius and
              contralateral tibialis anterior EMG activity, while the
              contralateral gastrocnemius and ipsilateral tibialis anterior EMG
              activity were little affected. It is concluded that a modifiable
              timing within the stride cycle takes place with a coupling
              between ipsilateral support and contralateral swing phase. The
              neuronal control of this coupling is obviously based on
              ipsilateral modulation of leg extensor EMG by proprioceptive
              feedback and an appropriate central (e.g. spinal) modulation of
              contralateral tibialis anterior EMG activity.",

               requires little effort. The inherent difficulties associated
               with standing balance are not revealed until a pathology or
               injury impairs its control. Fundamentally, standing upright
               requires us to balance our unstable whole-body load within a
               small base of support. Small movements of the upright body are
               detected by various sensory receptors, all encoding these
               movements through their own coordinate system with specific
               dynamics. The balance controller filters, processes, and
               integrates sensory cues of body motion to produce an error
               signal between predicted and actual sensory consequences of
               balance-related movements. Compensatory motor commands are
               generated in response to this error to maintain upright
               standing. In the present review, we first briefly describe the
               biomechanics and sensor dynamics of standing balance. We further
               review sensorimotor and perceptual approaches revealing
               operational principles of the balance system, along with
               computational approaches that explore control processes

               learning distinct from force-field adaptation, sequence
               learning, and skill learning. Nevertheless, study of adaptation
               to visuomotor rotation has yielded a number of findings and
               principles that are likely of general importance to procedural
               learning and memory. First, rotation learning is implicit and
               appears to proceed through reduction in a visual prediction
               error generated by a forward model, such implicit adaptation
               occurs even when it is in conflict with an explicit task goal.
               Second, rotation learning is subject to different forms of
               interference: retrograde, anterograde through aftereffects, and
               contextual blocking of retrieval. Third, opposite rotations can
               be recalled within a short time interval without interference if
               implicit contextual cues (effector change) rather than explicit
               cues (color change) are used. Fourth, rotation learning
               consolidates both over time and with increased initial training
               (saturation learning).",

               selection of the gait itself (e.g., walk or run) through the
               specific parameters utilized (stride length, frequency, etc.) to
               the pattern of muscular excitation. The ultimate choices are
               determined neurally, but what is involved with deciding on the
               appropriate strategy? Human locomotion appears stereotyped not
               so much because the pattern is predetermined, but because these
               movement patterns are good solutions for providing movement
               utilizing the machinery available to the individual (the legs
               and their requisite components). Under different circumstances
               the appropriate solution may differ broadly (different gait) or
               subtly (different parameters). Interpretation of the neural
               decision making process would benefit from understanding the
               influences that are utilized in the selection of the appropriate
               solution in any set of circumstances, including normal
               conditions. In this review we survey an array of studies that
               point to energetic cost as a key input to the gait coordination
               system, and not just an outcome of the gait pattern implemented.
               We then use that information to rigorously define the construct
               proposed by Sparrow and Newell (1998) where the effects of
               environment, organism, and task act as constraints determining
               the solution set available, and the coordination pattern is then
               implemented under pressure for energetic economy. The fit
               between the environment and the organism define affordances that
               can be actualized. We rely on a novel conceptualization of task
               that recognizes that the task goal needs to be separated from
               the mechanisms that achieve it so that the selection of a
               particular implementation strategy can be exposed and
               understood. This reformulation of the Sparrow and Newell
               construct is then linked to the proposed pressure for economy by
               considering it as an optimization problem, where the most
               readily selected gait strategy will be the one that achieves the
               task goal at (or near) the energetic minimum.",

               researchers and clinicians optimize gait retraining as part of
               motor rehabilitation. However, studying human locomotor learning
               can be challenging. During infancy and childhood, the
               neuromuscular system is quite immature, and it is unlikely that
               locomotor learning during early stages of development is
               governed by the same mechanisms as in adulthood. By the time
               humans reach maturity, they are so proficient at walking that it
               is difficult to come up with a sufficiently novel task to study
               de novo locomotor learning. The split-belt treadmill, which has
               two belts that can drive each leg at a different speed, enables
               the study of both short- (i.e., immediate) and long-term (i.e.,
               over minutes-days; a form of motor learning) gait modifications

  abstract  = "Recent studies suggest that planned and corrective actions are
               recalibrated during some forms of motor adaptation. However,
               corrective (also known as reactive) movements in human
               locomotion are thought to simply reflect sudden environmental
               changes independently from sensorimotor recalibration. Thus, we
               asked whether corrective responses can indicate the motor
               system's adapted state following prolonged exposure to a novel
               walking situation inducing sensorimotor adaptation. We recorded
               electromyographic (EMG) signals bilaterally on 15 leg muscles
               before, during, and after split-belts walking (i.e., novel
               walking situation), in which the legs move at different speeds.
               We exploited the rapid temporal dynamics of corrective responses
               upon unexpected speed transitions to isolate them from the
               overall motor output. We found that corrective muscle activity
               was structurally different following short versus long exposures
               to split-belts walking. Only after a long exposure, removal of
               the novel environment elicited corrective muscle patterns that
               matched those expected in response to a perturbation opposite to
               the one originally experienced. This indicated that individuals
               who recalibrated their motor system adopted split-belts
               environment as their new ``normal'' and transitioning back to
               the original walking environment causes subjects to react as if
               it was novel to them. Interestingly, this learning declined with
               age, but steady state modulation of muscle activity during
               split-belts walking did not, suggesting potentially different
               neural mechanisms underlying these motor patterns. Taken
               together, our results show that corrective motor commands
               reflect the adapted state of the motor system, which is less
               flexible as we age.",

               determine whether size of the error affects the degree of
               learning. Twenty-two children (aged 2-5 y) walked on the
               split-belt treadmill on two separate days spaced 1 week apart.
               Twenty-eight adults served as controls. On Day 1, children
               experienced an abrupt change in belt speeds (from 1:1 to 2:1
               differential) resulting in large errors, or a gradual change
               (same change in speed over 12-15 min), resulting in small
               errors. Learning was measured by the size of the aftereffect
               upon return to a 1:1 differential. On Day 2 (1 week later), the
               leg on the fast belt was reversed, as was the method of
               introducing the speed differential. We found that the error size
               did not affect learning. Unexpectedly, learning was greater on
               Day 2 compared to Day 1, especially for children under 4 y of
               age, despite the fact that the task was opposite to that of Day
               1, and did not influence learning in adults. Hence, 11
               additional children under 4 y of age were tested with belts
               running at the same speed on Day 1, and with a 2:1 speed
               differential (abrupt introduction) on Day 2. Surprisingly,
               learning was again greater on Day 2. We conclude that size of
               error during split-belt walking does not affect learning, but
               experience on a treadmill does, especially for younger children.",

               completed 10min of split-belt treadmill walking, then 5min of

               characterize learning of a novel locomotor task in stroke
               survivors. We hypothesized that the presence of neurological
               dysfunction from stroke would result in slower learning of a
               locomotor task and decreased retention of what was learned and
               that these deficits would be related to level of sensorimotor

               linked to reduced walking performance and reduced participation
               in the community. OBJECTIVE: To determine the contribution of
               postintervention improvements in walking speed and
               spatiotemporal gait asymmetry to the reduction in the energy
               cost of walking after stroke. METHODS: In all, 42 individuals
               with chronic hemiparesis (>6 months poststroke) were recruited
               to participate in 12 weeks of walking rehabilitation. The energy
               cost of walking, walking speed, and step length, swing time, and
               stance time asymmetries were calculated pretraining and
               posttraining. Sequential regression analyses tested the
               cross-sectional (ie, pretraining) and longitudinal (ie,
               posttraining changes) relationships between the energy cost of
               walking versus speed and each measure of asymmetry. RESULTS:
               Pretraining walking speed ($\beta$ = -.506) and swing time
               asymmetry ($\beta$ = .403) predicted pretraining energy costs:
               (adj)R(2) = 0.713; F(3, 37) = 34.05; P < .001. In contrast,
               change in walking speed ($\beta$ = .340) and change in step
               length asymmetry ($\beta$ = .934) predicted change in energy
               costs with a significant interaction between these independent
               predictors: (adj)R(2) = 0.699; F(4, 31) = 21.326; P < .001.
               Moderation by the direction or the magnitude of pretraining
               asymmetry was not found. CONCLUSIONS: For persons in the chronic
               phase of stroke recovery, faster and more symmetric walking
               after intervention appears to be more energetically advantageous
               than merely walking faster or more symmetrically. This finding
               has important functional implications, given the relationship
               between the energy cost of walking and community walking

  abstract  = "Walking is a complex behavior for which the healthy nervous
               system favors a smooth, symmetric pattern. However, people often
               adopt an asymmetric walking pattern after neural or
               biomechanical damage (i.e., they limp). To better understand
               this aberrant motor pattern and how to change it, we studied
               walking adaptation to a split-belt perturbation where one leg is
               driven to move faster than the other. Initially, healthy adult
               subjects take asymmetric steps on the split-belt treadmill, but
               within 10-15 min people adapt to reestablish walking symmetry.
               Which of the many walking parameters does the nervous system
               change to restore symmetry during this complex act (i.e., what
               motor mappings are adapted to restore symmetric walking in this
               asymmetric environment)? Here we found two parameters that met
               our criteria for adaptive learning: a temporal motor output
               consisting of the duration between heel-strikes of the two legs
               (i.e., ``when'' the feet land) and a spatial motor output
               related to the landing position of each foot relative to one
               another (i.e., ``where'' the feet land). We found that when
               subjects walk in an asymmetric environment they smoothly change
               their temporal and spatial motor outputs to restore temporal and
               spatial symmetry in the interlimb coordination of their gait.
               These changes in motor outputs are stored and have to be
               actively deadapted. Importantly, the adaptation of temporal and
               spatial motor outputs is dissociable since subjects were able to
               adapt their temporal motor output without adapting the spatial
               output. Taken together, our results suggest that temporal and
               spatial control for symmetric gait can be adapted separately,
               and therefore we could potentially develop interventions
               targeting either temporal or spatial walking deficits.",

  author   = "Wei, Kunlin and K{\"o}rding, Konrad",
  abstract = "During motor adaptation the nervous system constantly uses error
              information to improve future movements. Today's mainstream
              models simply assume that the nervous system adapts linearly and
              proportionally to errors. However, not all movement errors are
              relevant to our own action. The environment may transiently
              disturb the movement production-for example, a gust of wind blows
              the tennis ball away from its intended trajectory. Apparently the
              nervous system should not adapt its motor plan in the subsequent
              tennis strokes based on this irrelevant movement error. We
              hypothesize that the nervous system estimates the relevance of
              each observed error and adapts strongly only to relevant errors.
              Here we present a Bayesian treatment of this problem. The model
              calculates how likely an error is relevant to the motor plant and
              derives an ideal adaptation strategy that leads to the most
              precise movements. This model predicts that adaptation should be
              a nonlinear function of the size of an error. In reaching
              experiments we found strong evidence for the predicted nonlinear
              strategy. The model also explains published data on saccadic gain
              adaptation, adaptation to visuomotor rotations, and force
              perturbations. Our study suggests that the nervous system
              constantly and effortlessly estimates the relevance of observed
              movement errors for successful motor adaptation.",

              cortices are modulated during increasing levels of bimanual force
              generation in intact humans remains poorly understood. Here we
              studied coherence between electroencephalographic (EEG) signals
              and the ipsilateral cortical silent period (iSP), two well-known
              measures of interhemispheric connectivity between motor cortices,
              during unilateral and bilateral 10\%, 40\%, and 70\% of maximal
              isometric voluntary contraction (MVC) into index finger
              abduction. We found that EEG-EEG coherence in the alpha frequency
              band decreased while the iSP area increased during bilateral
              compared with unilateral 40\% and 70\% but not 10\% of MVC.
              Decreases in coherence in the alpha frequency band correlated
              with increases in the iSP area, and subjects who showed this

              increased coherence in the alpha frequency band and decreased the
              iSP area during bilateral 70\% of MVC. Altogether, our findings
              demonstrate an inverse relation between alpha oscillations and
              the iSP during strong levels of bimanual force generation. We

              are dependent on the temporal scales or frequencies, with higher

              possible, functional recovery might be more sustainable as it
              ensures a long-term reduction in impairment and an improvement in
              quality of life. At the same time, neurorehabilitation permits
              the scientific community to collect valuable data, which allows
              inferring about the principles of brain organization. Hence
              neuroscience sheds light on the mechanisms of learning new
              functions or relearning lost ones. However, current
              rehabilitation methods lack the exact operationalization of
              evidence gained from skill learning literature, leading to an
              urgent need to bridge motor learning theory and present clinical
              work in order to identify a set of ingredients and practical
              applications that could guide future interventions. This work
              aims to unify the neuroscientific literature relevant to the
              recovery process and rehabilitation practice in order to provide
              a synthesis of the principles that constitute an effective
              neurorehabilitation approach. Previous attempts to achieve this
              goal either focused on a subset of principles or did not link
              clinical application to the principles of motor learning and
              recovery. We identified 15 principles of motor learning based on
              existing literature: massed practice, spaced practice, dosage,
              task-specific practice, goal-oriented practice, variable
              practice, increasing difficulty, multisensory stimulation,
              rhythmic cueing, explicit feedback/knowledge of results, implicit
              feedback/knowledge of performance, modulate effector selection,
              action observation/embodied practice, motor imagery, and social
              interaction. We comment on trials that successfully implemented
              these principles and report evidence from experiments with
              healthy individuals as well as clinical work.",

              sensorimotor integration - the neural process of using sensory
              input to plan, guide, and correct movements. Previous studies
              have shown that the complexity of motor output is low when
              sensory feedback is withheld during precision motor tasks.
              However, much of this research has focused on motor behavior
              rather than neural processing, and therefore, has not
              specifically assessed the role of sensorimotor neural functioning
              in the execution of complex motor behavior. The present study
              uses a stimulus-tracking task with simultaneous
              electroencephalography (EEG) recording to assess the effect of
              visual feedback on motor performance, motor complexity, and
              sensorimotor neural processing in healthy adults. The complexity

              in frequency bands (alpha and beta) and scalp regions (central,
              parietal, and occipital) that are associated with sensorimotor
              processing. Consistent with previous literature, motor
              performance and its complexity were higher when visual feedback
              was provided relative to when it was withheld. The complexity of
              the neural signal was also higher when visual feedback was
              provided. This was most robust at frequency bands (alpha and
              beta) and scalp regions (parietal and occipital) associated with
              sensorimotor processing. The findings show that visual feedback

  abstract = "The brain constantly generates predictions about the environment
              to guide action. Unexpected events lead to surprise and can
              necessitate the modification of ongoing behavior. Surprise can
              occur for any sensory domain, but it is not clear how these
              separate surprise signals are integrated to affect motor output.
              By applying a trial-to-trial Bayesian surprise model to human
              electroencephalography data recorded during a cross-modal oddball
              task, we tested whether there are separate predictive models for
              different sensory modalities (visual, auditory), or whether
              expectations are integrated across modalities such that surprise
              in one modality decreases surprise for a subsequent unexpected
              event in the other modality. We found that while surprise was
              represented in a common frontal signature across sensory
              modalities (the fronto-central P3 event-related potential), the
              single-trial amplitudes of this signature more closely conformed
              to a model with separate surprise terms for each sensory domain.
              We then investigated whether surprise-related fronto-central P3
              activity indexes the rapid inhibitory control of ongoing behavior
              after surprise, as suggested by recent theories. Confirming this
              prediction, the fronto-central P3 amplitude after both auditory
              and visual unexpected events was highly correlated with the
              fronto-central P3 found after stop-signals (measured in a
              separate stop-signal task). Moreover, surprise-related and
              stopping-related activity loaded onto the same component in a
              cross-task independent components analysis. Together, these
              findings suggest that medial frontal cortex maintains separate
              predictive models for different sensory domains, but engages a
              common mechanism for inhibitory control of behavior regardless of
              the source of surprise.",

  author   = "Haddad, Ali E and Najafizadeh, Laleh",
  abstract = "GOAL: Understanding the dynamics of brain function through
              non-invasive monitoring techniques requires the development of
              computational methods that can deal with the non-stationary
              properties of recorded activities. As a solution to this problem,
              a new data-driven segmentation method for recordings obtained
              through electroencephalography (EEG) is presented. METHODS: The
              proposed method utilizes singular value decomposition (SVD) to
              identify the time intervals in the EEG recordings during which
              the spatial distribution of clusters of active cortical neurons
              remains quasi-stationary. Theoretical analysis shows that the
              spatial locality features of these clusters can be,
              asymptotically, captured by the most significant left singular
              subspace of the EEG data. A reference/sliding window approach is
              employed to dynamically extract this feature subspace, and the
              running projection error is monitored for significant changes
              using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. RESULTS: Simulation results, for a
              wide range of possible scenarios regarding the spatial
              distribution of active cortical neurons, show that the algorithm
              is successful in accurately detecting the segmental structure of
              the simulated EEG data. The algorithm is also applied to
              experimental EEG recordings of a modified visual oddball task.
              Results identify a unique sequence of dynamic patterns in the
              event-related potential (ERP) response to each of the three
              involved stimuli. CONCLUSION: The proposed method, without using
              source localization methods or scalp topographical maps, is able
              to identify intervals of quasi-stationarity in the EEG
              recordings. SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed segmentation technique can
              offer new insights on the dynamics of functional organization of
              the brain in action.",

               task-specifically linked by a soft-wired 'neural coupling'
               mechanism (e.g. the legs during balancing, the arms and legs
               during gait and both arms during cooperative hand movements).
               Experimentally this mechanism became evident by the analysis of

               reflected by the task-specific appearance of reflex EMG
               responses to non-noxious nerve stimulation, not only in muscles
               of the stimulated limb, but also, with same long latency, in
               muscles of meaningful coupled (contralateral) limb(s). After a
               stroke, nerve stimulation of the unaffected limb during such

               other terrestrial animals in both the hindlimb and forelimb were

               the lumbar segments, however, were more highly coordinated than

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: We investigated to what extent intralimb and
               interlimb cutaneous reflexes are altered while simultaneously
               performing arm and leg cycling (AL cycling) under different
               kinematic and postural conditions. METHODS: Eleven subjects
               performed AL cycling under conditions in which the arm and leg
               crank ipsilateral to the stimulation side were moved
               synchronously (in-phase cycling) or asynchronously (anti-phase
               cycling) while sitting or standing. Cutaneous reflexes following
               superficial radial or superficial peroneal nerve stimulation
               (2.0-2.5 times radiating threshold, 5 pulses at 333 Hz) were
               recorded at 4 different pedal positions from 12 muscles in the
               upper and lower limbs. Cutaneous reflexes with a peak latency of
               80-120 ms were then analyzed. RESULTS: The magnitude of
               interlimb and intralimb cutaneous reflexes in the arm and leg
               muscles was significantly modulated depending on the crank
               position for the relevant limb (phase-dependent modulation). A
               significant correlation between the magnitude of the cutaneous
               reflex and background EMG was observed in the majority of
               muscles during static contraction, but not during AL cycling
               (task-dependent modulation). No significant difference was found
               in comparisons of the magnitude of intralimb and interlimb
               cutaneous reflexes obtained during in- and anti-phase AL
               cycling. Qualitatively, the same results were obtained during AL
               cycling while sitting or standing. In addition, the modulation
               of cutaneous reflexes in arm muscles was identical among
               in-phase, anti-phase and isolated arm cycling. Results were the
               same for leg muscles. CONCLUSIONS: Cutaneous reflexes in arm
               muscles are little influenced by rhythmic movement of the legs
               and vice versa during AL cycling. It is likely that neural
               components that control interlimb reflexes are loosely coupled
               during AL cycling while sitting or standing. SIGNIFICANCE: Our
               results provide a better understanding of the coordination
               between the upper and lower limbs during rhythmic movement.",

               pre-activation control",
  author    = "M{\"u}ller, Roy and Grimmer, Sten and Blickhan, Reinhard",
  abstract  = "In locomotion, humans have to deal with irregularities of the
               ground, i.e., pathways covered with stones, grass, or roots.
               When they encounter ground with changes in terrain height they
               seem to use spring-mass dynamics to help passively stabilize
               their locomotory trajectory. With increasing step heights humans
               reduce their leg stiffness, but it is as of yet unclear whether
               these leg adjustments are purely passively achieved or actively
               in a feed-forward manner. For this, we investigated the
               stiffness regulation in the ankle and knee joint and analyzed
               the correlation between EMG, kinematic, and dynamic parameters.
               Nine healthy participants were running along a 17m runway with a
               force plate of adjustable height (steps of 0, +5, +10, and
               +15cm). Whole body kinematics was monitored along with surface
               electromyography of three selected bilateral lower limb muscles.
               We found that the stiffness of the ankle joint is adjusted to
               the vertical height of a step, in a manner similar to global leg
               stiffness. Furthermore, the integrated 100ms pre-activation of
               the m. gastrocnemius medialis (GM) depends on the vertical
               height of a step and correlates highly significantly with the
               activation of the GM but also with kinematics and dynamics.
               Consequently, we identified the pre-activation control as a key
               for altering the leg posture in preparation for altered ground
               properties (e.g., the height of a step or an obstacle). During
               the stance phase the control of activation plays a minor role
               since geometry and the initial conditions (e.g., leg length,
               landing angle, and landing velocity) ensure an adequate
               adjustment of joint stiffness as well as leg stiffness.",

               coactivation during walking with balance perturbations",
  author    = "Thompson, Jessica D and Plummer, Prudence and Franz, Jason R",
  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Inspired by a reliance on visual feedback for
               movement control in older age, optical flow perturbations
               provide a unique opportunity to study the neuromuscular
               mechanisms involved in walking balance control, including aging
               and falls history effects on the response to environmental
               balance challenges. Specifically, antagonist leg muscle
               coactivation, which increases with age during walking, is
               considered a neuromuscular defense against age-associated
               deficits in balance control. The purpose of this study was to
               investigate the effects of age and falls history on antagonist
               leg muscle coactivation during walking with and without optical
               flow perturbations of different amplitudes. METHODS: Eleven
               young adults [mean (standard deviation) age: 24.8 (4.8) years],
               eleven older non-fallers [75.3 (5.4) years] and eleven older
               fallers [age: 78 (7.6) years] participated in this study.
               Participants completed 2-minute walking trials while watching a
               speed-matched virtual hallway that, in some conditions, included
               mediolateral optical flow perturbations designed to elicit the
               visual perception of imbalance. FINDINGS: We first found that
               lower leg antagonist muscle coactivation during normal walking
               increased with age, independent of falls history. We also found
               that older but not young adults increased antagonist leg muscle
               coactivation in the presence of optical flow perturbations, with
               more pervasive effects in older adults with a history of falls.
               INTERPRETATION: Our findings allude to a greater susceptibility
               to optical flow perturbations in older fallers during walking,
               which points to a higher potential for risk of instability in
               more complex and dynamic everyday environments. These findings
               may also have broader impacts related to the design of
               innovative training paradigms and neuromuscular targets for
               falls prevention.",

               ankle coactivation on the paretic and non-paretic sides of
               subjects with hemiparesis and to examine the relationship of
               ankle coactivation with postural instability, motor deficit of
               the paretic lower extremity and locomotor performance.
               Electromyography of the medial gastrocnemius (MG) and tibialis
               anterior (TA) muscles were recorded bilaterally during gait in
               30 subjects (62.1+/-9.9 years) who had suffered a recent stroke
               (<6 months) as well as on one side of 17 healthy controls
               (59.3+/-9.1 years) walking at very slow speed. Ankle muscle
               coactivation was calculated by dividing the time of overlap
               between MG and TA signals (threshold of 20 microV) by the
               duration of the gait phases of interest: stance, swing, first
               and second double support sub-phases and single support
               sub-phase. The time spent in single support and the peak
               plantarflexor moment of force on the paretic side were used to
               measure, respectively, postural stability and dynamic strength
               of the paretic plantarflexors. The subjects with hemiparesis
               demonstrated less coactivation on the paretic side during the
               single support sub-phase (p<0.01) and more coactivation during
               first and second double support sub-phases on the non-paretic
               side (p<0.001) compared to control values. The patients with
               coactivation patterns that differed the most from controls were
               the patients with the more severe impairments and disabilities.
               While the reduced coactivation on the paretic side may
               contribute to poor postural stability and poor locomotor
               performance, the presence of excessive coactivation on the
               non-paretic side when both limbs were in ground contact may be
               an adaptation to help maintain postural stability during gait.",

               The activation level was quantified by means of the twitch

               performed downward stepping from a platform set at 20\% body
               height. The leg was modeled as a simple mass-spring system. From

               provide an overview of the pedaling technique using an
               electromyographic (EMG) approach. Literature concerning the
               electromyographic analysis of pedaling is reviewed in an effort
               to make a synthesis of the available information, and to point
               out its relevance for researchers, clinicians and/or
               cycling/triathlon trainers. The first part of the review depicts
               methodological aspects of the EMG signal recording and
               processing. We show how the pattern of muscle activation during
               pedaling can be analyzed in terms of muscle activity level and
               muscle activation timing. Muscle activity level is generally
               quantified with root mean square or integrated EMG values.
               Muscle activation timing is studied by defining EMG signal onset
               and offset times that identify the duration of EMG bursts and,
               more recently, by the determination of a lag time maximizing the
               cross-correlation coefficient. In the second part of the review,
               we describe whether the patterns of the lower limb muscles
               activity are influenced by numerous factors affecting pedaling
               such as power output, pedaling rate, body position, shoe-pedal

               usually a linear, relationship between muscle force and smoothed

               those measured during isometric actions. A further consideration
               in relating force to EMG is that the force signal has a much
               lower frequency content than the rectified EMG. Finally, the
               limited speed of the activation and deactivation process results

               additional musculoskeletal and mathematical modelling. A
               numerical method of static optimization was used in this study
               to evaluate muscular forces during gait. The numerical algorithm
               used was built on the basis of traditional optimization
               techniques, i.e., constrained minimization technique using the
               Lagrange multiplier method to solve for constraints. Measuring
               exact muscle forces during gait analysis is not currently
               possible. The developed optimization method calculates optimal
               forces during gait, given a specific performance criterion,
               using kinematics and kinetics from gait analysis together with
               muscle architectural data. Experimental methods to validate
               mathematical methods to calculate forces are limited.
               Electromyography (EMG) is frequently used as a tool to determine
               muscle activation in experimental studies on human motion. A
               method of estimating force from the EMG signal, the EMG-to-force
               approach, was recently developed by Bogey et al. [Bogey RA,
               Perry J, Gitter AJ. An EMG-to-force processing approach for
               determining ankle muscle forcs during normal human gait. IEEE
               Trans Neural Syst Rehabil Eng 2005;13:302-10] and is based on
               normalization of activation during a maximum voluntary
               contraction to documented maximal muscle strength. This method
               was adapted in this study as a tool with which to compare static
               optimization during a gait cycle. Muscle forces from static
               optimization and from EMG-to-force muscle forces show reasonably
               good correlation in the plantarflexor and dorsiflexor muscles,
               but less correlation in the knee flexor and extensor muscles.
               Additional comparison of the mathematical muscle forces from
               static optimization to documented averaged EMG data reveals good
               overall correlation to patterns of evaluated muscular
               activation. This indicates that on an individual level, muscular
               force patterns from mathematical models can arguably be more
               accurate than from those obtained from surface EMG during gait,
               though magnitude must still be validated.",

  abstract  = "Accurate force prediction from surface electromyography (EMG)
               forms an important methodological challenge in biomechanics and
               kinesiology. In a previous study (Staudenmann et al., 2006), we
               illustrated force estimates based on analyses lent from
               multivariate statistics. In particular, we showed the advantages
               of principal component analysis (PCA) on monopolar high-density
               EMG (HD-EMG) over conventional electrode configurations. In the
               present study, we further improve force estimates by exploiting
               the correlation structure of the HD-EMG via independent
               component analysis (ICA). HD-EMG from the triceps brachii muscle
               and the extension force of the elbow were measured in 11
               subjects. The root mean square difference (RMSD) and correlation
               coefficients between predicted and measured force were
               determined. Relative to using the monopolar EMG data, PCA
               yielded a 40\% reduction in RMSD. ICA yielded a significant
               further reduction of up to 13\% RMSD. Since ICA improved the
               PCA-based estimates, the independent structure of EMG signals
               appears to contain relevant additional information for the
               prediction of muscle force from surface HD-EMG.",

               eccentric contraction at 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100\% of the maximal

               and MMG/force relationships (P<0.001). The EMG root mean square
               (rms) values increased significantly from 0 to 50\% MVC during
               concentric and isometric contraction and up to 75\% MVC during

               significantly from 0 to 50\% MVC during concentric contraction

               distinguishes single MUAPs from superpositions, and sets up the

              tissues is subject dependent, so non-invasive methods for
              conductivity estimation are necessary to fine tune EEG models. To
              do so, the EEG forward problem solution (so-called lead field
              matrix) must be computed for a large number of conductivity

  abstract = "Both neural activity and behavior of highly trained animals are
              strikingly variable across repetition of behavioral trials. The
              neural variability consistently decreases during behavioral
              tasks, in both sensory and motor cortices. The behavioral
              variability, on the other hand, changes depending on the
              difficulty of the task and animal performance. Here we study a
              mechanism for such variability in spiking neural network models
              with cluster topologies that enable multistability and attractor
              dynamics, features subserving functional roles suchas
              decision-making, (working) memory and learning. Multistable
              attractors have been studied in spiking neural networks through
              clusters of strongly interconnected excitatory neurons. However,
              we show that this network topology results in the loss of
              excitation/inhibition balance and does not confer robustness
              against modulation of network activity. Moreover, it leads to
              widely separated firing rate states of single neurons,
              inconsistent with experimental observations. To overcome these
              problems we propose that a combination of excitatory and
              inhibitory clustering restores local excitation/inhibition
              balance. This network architecture is inspired by recent
              anatomicaland physiological studies which point to increased
              local inhibitory connectivity and possible inhibitory clustering
              through connection strengths. We find that inhibitory clustering
              supports realistic spiking activity in terms of a biologically
              realistic firing rate, spiking irregularity, and trial-to-trial
              spike count variability. Furthermore, with the appropriate
              stimulation of network clusters, this network topology enabled us
              to qualitatively and quantitatively reproduce in vivo firing

                   attributes small generalization error either to properties
                   of the model family, or to the regularization techniques
                   used during training. Through extensive systematic

                   to explain why large neural networks generalize well in

              control seems necessary to adapt gait pattern with environmental
              constraints. In order to study cortical activity during real
              locomotion, electroencephalography (EEG) appears to be
              particularly appropriate. It is now possible to record changes in
              cortical neural synchronization/desynchronization during gait.
              Studying gait initiation is also of particular interest because
              it implies motor and cognitive cortical control to adequately
              perform a step. Time-frequency analysis enables to study induced
              changes in EEG activity in different frequency bands. Such
              analysis reflects cortical activity implied in stabilized gait
              control but also in more challenging tasks (obstacle crossing,
              changes in speed, dual tasks…). These spectral patterns are
              directly influenced by the walking context but, when analyzing

              cortical areas that are involved in motor control: the anterior

              proper, or SMA), and, in the anterior cingulate cortex, the

              and visually triggered movements. Healthy subjects performed
              self-initiated movements of the right fingers (self-initiated
              task, SI). Each movement elicited a visual signal that was
              recorded. The recorded sequence of visual signals was played
              back, and the subjects moved the right fingers in response to
              each signal (visually triggered task, VT). There were two types
              of movements: repetitive (FIXED) or sequential (SEQUENCE),
              performed at two different rates: SLOW or FAST. The four regions
              of interest (pre-SMA, SMA, RCZ, CCZ) were traced on a

              analysis, consisting of individual assessment of significant
              activation, revealed a bilateral activation in the four mesial
              structures for all movement conditions, but SI movements were
              more efficient than VT movements. The more complex and more rapid
              the movements, the smaller the difference in activation
              efficiency between the SI and the VT tasks, which indicated an
              additional processing role of the mesial motor areas involving
              both the type and rate of movements. Quantitative analysis was
              performed on the spatial extent of the area activated and the
              percentage of change in signal amplitude. In the pre-SMA,
              activation was more extensive for SI than for VT movements, and
              for fast than for slow movements; the extent of activation was
              larger in the ipsilateral pre-SMA. In the SMA, the difference was
              not significant in the extent and magnitude of activation between
              SI and VT movements, but activation was more extensive for
              sequential than for fixed movements. In the RCZ and CCZ, both the
              extent and magnitude of activation were larger for SI than for VT

              larger for sequential than for fixed movements, and for fast than
              for slow movements. These data suggest functional specificities
              of the frontomesial motor areas with respect not only to the mode
              of movement initiation (self-initiated or externally triggered)

              either normalization (maximum voluntary contraction - MVC - or
              maximum amplitude of the signal - SELF) or band-pass filter

              had the effect of decreasing the variance accounted for by a set
              number of synergies and affected individual muscle contributions.
              Extreme smoothing (i.e., LP cut-off 0.5 Hz) enhanced the contrast

              taught as a whole, even though training of simple movement
              components before training the entire movement has been shown to
              be more effective for particularly complex tasks (``part-whole
              transfer paradigm''). The important implication of the part-whole
              transfer paradigm, e.g. on the field of rehabilitation robotics,
              is that training of most complex tasks could be simplified and,
              subsequently, devices used to train can become simpler and more
              affordable. In this way, robot-assisted rehabilitation could
              become more accessible. However, often the last step in the
              training process is forgotten: the recomposition of several
              simple movement components to a complete complex movement.
              Therefore, at least for the last training step, a complex
              rehabilitation device may be required.In a pilot study, we wanted
              to investigate if a complex robotic device (e.g. an exoskeleton
              robot with many degrees of freedom), such as the ARMin
              rehabilitation robot, is really beneficial for training the
              coordination between several simpler movement components or if
              training using visual feedback would lead to equal benefits. In a
              study, involving 16 healthy participants, who were instructed in
              a complex rugby motion, we could show first trends on the
              following two aspects: i) the part-whole transfer paradigm seems
              to hold true and therefore, simple robots might be used for
              training movement primitives. ii) Visual feedback does not seem
              to have the same potential, at least in healthy humans, to
              replace visuo-haptic guidance for movement recomposition of
              complex tasks. Therefore, complex rehabilitation robots seem to

  abstract = "Motivation plays a crucial role in motor learning and
              neurorehabilitation. Participants' motivation could decline to a
              point where they may stop training when facing a very difficult
              task. Conversely, participants may perform well and consider the
              training boring if the task is too easy. In this paper, we
              present a combination of a virtual reality environment with
              different robotic training strategies that modify task functional
              difficulty to enhance participants' motivation. We employed a
              pneumatically driven robotic stepper as a haptic interface. We
              first evaluated the use of disturbance observers as acceleration
              controllers to provide high robustness to varying system
              parameters, unmodeled dynamics and unknown disturbances
              associated with pneumatic control. The locomotor task to be
              learned in the virtual reality environment consisted of steering
              a recumbent bike to follow a desired path by changing the
              movement frequency of the dominant leg. The motor task was
              specially designed to engage implicit learning -i.e., learning
              without conscious recognition of what is learned. A haptic
              assistance strategy was developed in order to reduce the task
              functional difficulty during practice. In a feasibility study
              with eight healthy participants, we found that the haptic
              assistance provided by the robotic device successfully
              contributed to improve task performance during training,
              especially for less skilled participants. Furthermore, we found a
              negative correlation between participants' motivation and
              performance error when training with haptic assistance,
              suggesting that haptic assistance has a great potential to
              enhance motivation during motor training.",

  abstract = "Up to date, the functional gains obtained after robot-aided gait
              rehabilitation training are limited. Error augmenting strategies
              have a great potential to enhance motor learning of simple motor
              tasks. However, little is known about the effect of these error
              modulating strategies on complex tasks, such as relearning to
              walk after a neurologic accident. Additionally, neuroimaging
              evaluation of brain regions involved in learning processes could
              provide valuable information on behavioral outcomes. We
              investigated the effect of robotic training strategies that
              augment errors-error amplification and random force
              disturbance-and training without perturbations on brain
              activation and motor learning of a complex locomotor task.
              Thirty-four healthy subjects performed the experiment with a
              robotic stepper (MARCOS) in a 1.5 T MR scanner. The task
              consisted in tracking a Lissajous figure presented on a display
              by coordinating the legs in a gait-like movement pattern.
              Behavioral results showed that training without perturbations
              enhanced motor learning in initially less skilled subjects, while
              error amplification benefited better-skilled subjects. Training
              with error amplification, however, hampered transfer of learning.
              Randomly disturbing forces induced learning and promoted transfer
              in all subjects, probably because the unexpected forces increased
              subjects' attention. Functional MRI revealed main effects of
              training strategy and skill level during training. A main effect
              of training strategy was seen in brain regions typically
              associated with motor control and learning, such as, the basal
              ganglia, cerebellum, intraparietal sulcus, and angular gyrus.
              Especially, random disturbance and no perturbation lead to
              stronger brain activation in similar brain regions than error
              amplification. Skill-level related effects were observed in the
              IPS, in parts of the superior parietal lobe (SPL), i.e.,
              precuneus, and temporal cortex. These neuroimaging findings
              indicate that gait-like motor learning depends on interplay
              between subcortical, cerebellar, and fronto-parietal brain
              regions. An interesting observation was the low activation
              observed in the brain's reward system after training with error
              amplification compared to training without perturbations. Our
              results suggest that to enhance learning of a locomotor task,
              errors should be augmented based on subjects' skill level. The
              impacts of these strategies on motor learning, brain activation,
              and motivation in neurological patients need further
              investigation.",

              identify weighted groups of muscles activated together during

              synergies, understanding how EMG data processing impacts results
              and clinical interpretation is important. The aim of this study
              was to evaluate how EMG signal processing impacts synergy outputs
              during gait. We evaluated the impacts of two common processing
              steps for synergy analyses: low pass (LP) filtering and unit
              variance scaling. We evaluated EMG data collected during barefoot
              walking from five muscles of 113 children with cerebral palsy
              (CP) and 73 typically-developing (TD) children. We applied LP
              filters to the EMG data with cutoff frequencies ranging from 4 to
              40 Hz (reflecting the range reported in prior synergy research).
              We also evaluated the impact of normalizing EMG amplitude by unit
              variance. We found that the total variance accounted for (tVAF)
              by a given number of synergies was sensitive to LP filter choice
              and decreased in both TD and CP groups with increasing LP cutoff
              frequency (e.g., 9.3 percentage points change for one synergy
              between 4 and 40 Hz). This change in tVAF can alter the number of
              synergies selected for further analyses. Normalizing tVAF to a
              z-score (e.g., dynamic motor control index during walking,
              walk-DMC) reduced sensitivity to LP cutoff. Unit variance scaling
              caused comparatively small changes in tVAF. Synergy weights and
              activations were impacted less than tVAF by LP filter choice and
              unit variance normalization. These results demonstrate that EMG
              signal processing methods impact outputs of synergy analysis and
              z-score based measures can assist in reporting and comparing
              results across studies and clinical centers.",

               adjustments appear to involve an active lateral transfer of
               weight to the stance leg. The present study demonstrates that
               these anticipatory adjustments often do not appear in
               compensatory stepping responses evoked by postural perturbation.
               Compensatory stepping without anticipatory active weight
               transfer seemed to be more likely to occur when stepping was not
               pre-planned or when the perturbation characteristics were novel.
               The substantial variability seen in the anticipatory weight
               transfer, when it did occur, contrasts the consistency of the
               anticipatory responses seen in gait initiation and other
               non-compensatory leg movements. The results suggest that there
               may be fundamental differences in the control of compensatory
               versus non-compensatory stepping, and may provide insight into
               the sequencing of anticipatory postural reactions and subsequent
               leg movements.",

               of stance perturbation. A corticospinal contribution to the
               compensatory response of the Sol is under debate. The present
               study assessed spinal, corticospinal, and cortical excitability
               at the peaks of short- (SLR), medium- (MLR), and long-latency
               responses (LLR) after posterior translation of the feet.
               Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and peripheral nerve
               stimulation were individually adjusted so that the peaks of
               either motor evoked potential (MEP) or H reflex coincided with
               peaks of SLR, MLR, and LLR, respectively. The influence of
               specific, presumably direct, corticospinal pathways was
               investigated by H-reflex conditioning. When TMS was triggered so
               that the MEP arrived in the Sol at the same time as the peaks of
               SLR and MLR, EMG remained unaffected. Enhanced EMG was observed
               when the MEP coincided with the LLR peak (P < 0.001). Similarly,
               conditioning of the H reflex by subthreshold TMS facilitated H
               reflexes only at LLR (P < 0.001). The earliest facilitation
               after perturbation occurred after 86 ms. The TMS-induced
               H-reflex facilitation at LLR suggests that increased cortical
               excitability contributes to the augmentation of the LLR peaks.
               This provides evidence that the LLR in the Sol muscle is at
               least partly transcortical, involving direct corticospinal
               pathways. Additionally, these results demonstrate that
               approximately 86 ms after perturbation, postural compensatory
               responses are cortically mediated.",

               (N=18) whose motor-evoked potentials could be induced
               participated in this study. Subjects in each hemiparesis
               postonset of short (12mo) duration group were randomly assigned
               to either the control or experimental group. Interventions
               Subjects in the experimental groups participated in BWSTT for 4
               weeks. Those in the control groups received the general exercise
               program. Main Outcome Measures The primary outcomes were motor
               threshold and map size of the abductor hallucis muscle in the
               ipsilesional hemisphere. The secondary outcome was Fugl-Meyer

               after completing the 4 weeks of training. Results The 4-week
               BWSTT resulted in a decrease of motor threshold and an increase
               of map size in subjects with hemiparesis of short duration,

  abstract  = "The time it takes between consecutive foot contacts from the

               investigations have shown that the variations that are present
               in the stride time intervals are linked to walking balance. In
               this study, functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was
               utilized to evaluate whether activation in the medial
               sensorimotor cortices reflects the amount of variations seen in
               the stride-time intervals. Thirteen healthy adults (Age=23.7
               $\pm$ 1.4 yrs.) walked forwards and backwards on a programmable
               treadmill. Each walking condition consisted of two sessions,
               with each being comprised of five alternating blocks of standing
               still or walking at 0.45 m/s. Activation in the medial
               sensorimotor cortices was measured using an fNIRS system, which
               consisted of a 4 $\times$ 4 grid of infrared optode
               emitter/detector pairs. The optodes were positioned on the
               participant's head using the International 10/20 system with Cz
               located beneath the center of the front two rows of optodes. We
               evaluated the block-wise changes in the amount of oxygenated
               (oxyHb) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (deoxyHb) in the channels
               that were located over the supplementary motor area, pre-central
               gyrus, post-central gyrus and superior parietal lobule.
               Throughout the experiment, a footswitch system was used to
               concurrently measure the amount of variation present in the
               stride-time intervals. Our results showed that oxyHb was greater
               in the supplementary motor area, pre-central gyrus, and superior
               parietal lobule when participants walked backwards rather than
               forwards, which suggests that backward walking presents more of
               a challenge to the nervous system as it controls the stepping
               pattern. Additionally, there was a significant decrease in the
               amount of deoxyHb present in the supplementary motor area while
               walking backward. Consistent with previous investigations, we
               noted that the amount of variability present in the stride-time
               intervals was greater during backward walking compared to
               forward walking. In addition, the amount of variation in the
               stride-time intervals while walking forward was positively
               correlated with the maximum oxyHb response found in the
               pre-central gyrus and supplementary motor area, which has not
               been previously shown. This neurobehavioral relationship
               supports the notion that the subtle variations found in the
               stride-time intervals are partly associated with processing
               demands by the motor cortices for regulating the forward
               temporal kinematics.",

              context of machine learning and introducing the predictive,
              descriptive, relevant (PDR) framework for discussing

               cortical response associated with postural reactions to
               predictable and unpredictable perturbations to upright stance.
               Postural threat was manipulated by having individuals stand on
               an elevated surface to alter the context in which the postural
               task was performed. Ten healthy young adults experienced a
               series of predictable and unpredictable trunk perturbations when
               standing at ground level and at the edge of a platform located
               3.2 m above the ground. Participants felt less confident, more
               fearful of falling, more anxious and less stable when standing
               at the high surface height. Unpredictable perturbations
               generated a large negative potential (N1) which was increased by
               84\% when standing at the high compared to low surface height.
               The magnitude of change in this potential was related to the
               magnitude of change in balance perceptions, such as confidence
               and fear. Predictable perturbations did not generate a N1
               potential but instead produced an anticipation-related potential
               prior to the perturbation. This cortical activity observed in
               response to predictable perturbations was not influenced by
               postural threat. A large N1 potential was observed for a
               'surprise' perturbation that followed a series of predictable
               perturbations. There was a trend for the amplitude of this
               potential to be increased when standing at the high compared to
               low surface height. The results of this study provide evidence
               for the modulating influence of psychological factors related to
               postural threat on the cortical activity associated with
               postural reactions to unpredictable perturbations.",

              predictable or unpredictable whole body perturbations which
              required balance corrections to maintain upright stability.
              Unpredictable perturbations evoked a large negative potential
              (e.g., CZ: -19.9+/-5.1 microV) that was similar in timing (e.g.,
              CZ: 98.9+/-5.5 ms) and shape to that reported in previous
              studies. This large negative potential was not discernable for
              perturbations with predictable onset timing and direction in
              spite of the presence of significant compensatory balance
              reactions. Importantly, when a surprise perturbation was

              large negative potential occurred on this trial even though
              subjects expected a predictable stimulus onset. This suggests

              interested in the role that motor planning plays in gait

              Virtual Environment (VE) feedback task on the EEG patterns during
              robot assisted walking. We compared walking in the VE modality to
              two control conditions: walking with a visual attention paradigm,
              in which visual stimuli were unrelated to the motor task; and
              walking with mirror feedback, in which participants observed
              their own movements. Eleven healthy participants were considered.
              Application of independent component analysis to the EEG revealed
              three independent component clusters in premotor and parietal
              areas showing increased activity during walking with the adaptive
              VE training paradigm compared to the control conditions. During
              the interactive VE walking task spectral power in frequency
              ranges 8-12, 15-20, and 23-40 Hz was significantly (p $\leq$
              0.05) decreased. This power decrease is interpreted as a
              correlate of an active cortical area. Furthermore activity in the
              premotor cortex revealed gait cycle related modulations
              significantly different (p $\leq$ 0.05) from baseline in the
              frequency range 23-40 Hz during walking. These modulations were
              significantly (p $\leq$ 0.05) reduced depending on gait cycle
              phases in the interactive VE walking task compared to the control

              increased activity during walking with the adaptive VE training
              paradigm, when compared to walking with mirror- and movement
              unrelated feedback. Previous research has related a
              premotor-parietal network to motor planning and motor intention.
              We argue that movement related interactive feedback enhances
              motor planning and motor intention. We hypothesize that this

  author   = "Hyde, Damon E and Duffy, Frank H and Warfield, Simon K",
  abstract = "Electromagnetic source localization (ESL) provides non-invasive
              evaluation of brain electrical activity for neurology research
              and clinical evaluation of neurological disorders such as
              epilepsy. Accurate ESL results are dependent upon the use of
              patient specific models of bioelectric conductivity. While the
              effects of anisotropic conductivities in the skull and white
              matter have been previously studied, little attention has been
              paid to the accurate modeling of the highly conductive
              cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) region. This study examines the effect
              that partial volume errors in CSF segmentations have upon the ESL
              bioelectric model. These errors arise when segmenting sulcal
              channels whose widths are similar to the resolution of the
              magnetic resonance (MR) images used for segmentation, as some
              voxels containing both CSF and gray matter cannot be definitively
              assigned a single label. These problems, particularly prevalent
              in pediatric populations, make voxelwise segmentation of CSF
              compartments a difficult problem. Given the high conductivity of
              CSF, errors in modeling this region may result in large errors in
              the bioelectric model. We introduce here a new approach for using
              estimates of partial volume fractions in the construction of
              patient specific bioelectric models. In regions where partial
              volume errors are expected, we use a layered gray matter-CSF
              model to construct equivalent anisotropic conductivity tensors.
              This allows us to account for the inhomogeneity of the tissue
              within each voxel. Using this approach, we are able to reduce the
              error in the resulting bioelectric models, as evaluated against a
              known high resolution model. Additionally, this model permits us
              to evaluate the effects of sulci modeling errors and quantify the
              mean error as a function of the change in sulci width. Our
              results suggest that both under and over-estimation of the CSF
              region leads to significant errors in the bioelectric model.
              While a model with fixed partial volume fraction is able to
              reduce this error, we see the largest improvement when using
              voxel specific partial volume estimates. Our cross-model analyses
              suggest that an approximately linear relationship exists between
              sulci error and the error in the resulting bioelectric model.
              Given the difficulty of accurately segmenting narrow sulcal
              channels, this suggests that our approach may be capable of
              improving the accuracy of patient specific bioelectric models by
              several percent, while introducing only minimal additional
              computational requirements.",

              the face of environmental challenges. Although changes in
              reactive balance over repeated perturbations have been observed
              previously, only anticipatory postural adjustments preceding
              voluntary movements have been studied in the framework of motor
              adaptation and learning theory. Here, we hypothesized that
              adaptation occurs in task-level balance control during responses
              to perturbations due to central changes in the control of both
              anticipatory and reactive components of balance. Our adaptation
              paradigm consisted of a Training set of forward support-surface
              perturbations, a Reversal set of novel countermanding
              perturbations that reversed direction, and a Washout set
              identical to the Training set. Adaptation was characterized by a
              change in a motor variable from the beginning to the end of each
              set, the presence of aftereffects at the beginning of the Washout
              set when the novel perturbations were removed, and a return of
              the variable at the end of the Washout to a level comparable to
              the end of the Training set. Task-level balance performance was
              characterized by peak center of mass (CoM) excursion and
              velocity, which showed adaptive changes with repetitive trials.
              Only small changes in anticipatory postural control,
              characterized by body lean and background muscle activity were
              observed. Adaptation was found in the evoked long-latency
              muscular response, and also in the sensorimotor transformation
              mediating that response. Finally, in each set, temporal patterns
              of muscle activity converged towards an optimum predicted by a
              trade-off between maximizing motor performance and minimizing
              muscle activity. Our results suggest that adaptation in balance,
              as well as other motor tasks, is mediated by altering central
              sensitivity to perturbations and may be driven by energetic
              considerations.",

  abstract = "1. The effect of central set on automatic postural responses was
              studied in humans exposed to horizontal support-surface
              perturbations causing forward sway. Central set was varied by
              providing subjects with prior experience of postural stimulus
              velocities or amplitudes under 1) serial and random conditions,
              2) expected and unexpected conditions, and 3) practiced and
              unpracticed conditions. In particular, the influence of
              central-set conditions was examined on the pattern and magnitude
              of six leg and trunk electromyograph (EMG) activations and
              associated ankle torque responses to postural perturbations with
              identical stimulus parameters. 2. The scaling of initial agonist
              integrated EMG (IEMG) and torque responses to postural
              perturbation amplitude disappeared when perturbation amplitudes
              were randomized. This finding suggests that the initial magnitude
              of postural responses were centrally set to anticipated postural
              perturbation amplitudes based on sequential experience with the
              stimulus. 3. Expectation of postural stimulus amplitude had a
              significant effect on initial torque responses; subjects
              overresponded when a larger perturbation was expected and
              underresponded when a smaller perturbation was expected.
              Expectation of postural stimulus velocity had a smaller effect on
              initial torque responses, and subjects consistently overresponded
              when the velocity of the perturbation was unexpected. This
              difference in amplitude and velocity expectation may be because
              of the capacity to encode stimulus velocity, but not amplitude
              information, into the earliest postural responses of the current
              trial. The relative strength of amplitude and velocity
              central-set effects varied widely with individual subjects. 4.
              Central-set conditions did not affect initial EMG response
              latencies (100 +/- 20 ms, mean +/- SD) or the relative onset of
              proximal and distal agonists and antagonists. Unexpected or
              unpracticed stimulus amplitudes, however, were associated with
              significant late activation of ankle antagonist, tibialis. Thus
              errors in initial response magnitude because of central-set
              effects appear to be partially corrected by reciprocal antagonist
              activity. Agonist IEMG, however, did not always reflect
              significant changes in torque responses with central-set
              conditions. 5. Expectation of postural stimulus amplitude and
              velocity had two different types of effects on the magnitudes of
              postural responses: 1) a directionally specific, central-set
              effect consisting of either increased or decreased responses,
              depending on expectation of stimulus amplitude; and 2) a
              nonspecific enhanced response to novel stimulus velocities with a
              gradual reduction when a velocity was presented repeatedly. Two
              different neural mechanisms are proposed for these two adaptive
              effects. 6. Reduction of postural response magnitude and
              antagonist activity during practice may be partially explained by
              adaptive mechanisms based on expectation because of prior
              experience with stimulus velocity and amp",

              Neurosci. Lett. 374, 174-178.] we described a fairly general
              analysis of induced responses-in electromagnetic brain
              signals-using the summary statistic approach and statistical
              parametric mapping. This involves localising induced responses-in
              peristimulus time and frequency-by testing for effects in
              time-frequency images that summarise the response of each subject
              to each trial type. Conventionally, these time-frequency
              summaries are estimated using post-hoc averaging of epoched data.
              However, post-hoc averaging of this sort fails when the induced
              responses overlap or when there are multiple response components
              that have variable timing within each trial (for example stimulus
              and response components associated with different reaction
              times). In these situations, it is advantageous to estimate
              response components using a convolution model of the sort that is
              standard in the analysis of fMRI time series. In this paper, we
              describe one such approach, based upon ordinary least squares
              deconvolution of induced responses to input functions encoding
              the onset of different components within each trial. There are a
              number of fundamental advantages to this approach: for example;
              (i) one can disambiguate induced responses to stimulus onsets and
              variably timed responses; (ii) one can test for the modulation of
              induced responses-over peristimulus time and frequency-by
              parametric experimental factors and (iii) one can gracefully
              handle confounds-such as slow drifts in power-by including them
              in the model. In what follows, we consider optimal forms for
              convolution models of induced responses, in terms of impulse
              response basis function sets and illustrate the utility of
              deconvolution estimators using simulated and real MEG data.",

               imagery-based brain-computer interface (BCI) system. Traditional
               deep learning (DL) methods usually perform better with more
               labeled training samples. Unfortunately, the labeled samples are
               usually scarce for electroencephalography (EEG) data, while
               unlabeled samples are available in large quantity and easy to
               collect. In addition, traditional DL algorithms are notoriously
               time-consuming for the training process. To address these
               issues, a novel method of hierarchical semi-supervised extreme
               learning machine (HSS-ELM) is proposed in this paper and applied
               for motor imagery (MI) task classification. Firstly, the deep
               architecture of hierarchical ELM (H-ELM) approach is employed
               for feature learning automatically, and then these new
               high-level features are classified using the semi-supervised ELM
               (SS-ELM) algorithm which can exploit the information from both
               labeled and unlabeled data. Extensive experiments were conducted
               on some benchmark datasets and EEG datasets to evaluate the
               effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with several
               state-of-the-art methods, including SVM, ELM, SAE, H-ELM, and
               SS-ELM, our HSS-ELM method can achieve better classification

               subjects in the training and evaluation sessions of BCI
               Competition IV Dataset 2a, respectively. Finally, it comes to
               the conclusion that the proposed method has achieved superior

  abstract  = "To overcome the individual differences, an accurate
               electroencephalogram (EEG)-based emotion-classification system
               requires a considerable amount of ecological calibration data
               for each individual, which is labor-intensive and
               time-consuming. Transfer learning (TL) has drawn increasing
               attention in the field of EEG signal mining in recent years. The
               TL leverages existing data collected from other people to build
               a model for a new individual with little calibration data.
               However, brute-force transfer to an individual (i.e., blindly
               leveraged the labeled data from others) may lead to a negative
               transfer that degrades performance rather than improving it.
               This study thus proposed a conditional TL (cTL) framework to
               facilitate a positive transfer (improving subject-specific
               performance without increasing the labeled data) for each
               individual. The cTL first assesses an individual's
               transferability for positive transfer and then selectively
               leverages the data from others with comparable feature spaces.
               The empirical results showed that among 26 individuals, the
               proposed cTL framework identified 16 and 14 transferable
               individuals who could benefit from the data from others for
               emotion valence and arousal classification, respectively. These
               transferable individuals could then leverage the data from 18
               and 12 individuals who had similar EEG signatures to attain
               maximal TL improvements in valence- and arousal-classification
               accuracy. The cTL improved the overall classification
               performance of 26 individuals by ~15\% for valence
               categorization and ~12\% for arousal counterpart, as compared to
               their default performance based solely on the subject-specific
               data. This study evidently demonstrated the feasibility of the
               proposed cTL framework for improving an individual's default
               emotion-classification performance given a data repository. The
               cTL framework may shed light on the development of a robust
               emotion-classification model using fewer labeled
               subject-specific data toward a real-life affective

                   a curious phenomenon in common: on the first layer they
                   learn features similar to Gabor filters and color blobs.
                   Such first-layer features appear not to be specific to a
                   particular dataset or task, but general in that they are
                   applicable to many datasets and tasks. Features must
                   eventually transition from general to specific by the last
                   layer of the network, but this transition has not been
                   studied extensively. In this paper we experimentally
                   quantify the generality versus specificity of neurons in
                   each layer of a deep convolutional neural network and report
                   a few surprising results. Transferability is negatively
                   affected by two distinct issues: (1) the specialization of
                   higher layer neurons to their original task at the expense
                   of performance on the target task, which was expected, and
                   (2) optimization difficulties related to splitting networks
                   between co-adapted neurons, which was not expected. In an
                   example network trained on ImageNet, we demonstrate that
                   either of these two issues may dominate, depending on
                   whether features are transferred from the bottom, middle, or
                   top of the network. We also document that the
                   transferability of features decreases as the distance
                   between the base task and target task increases, but that
                   transferring features even from distant tasks can be better
                   than using random features. A final surprising result is
                   that initializing a network with transferred features from
                   almost any number of layers can produce a boost to
                   generalization that lingers even after fine-tuning to the
                   target dataset.",

  abstract  = "Lateralization of mechanisms mediating functions such as
               language and perception is widely accepted as a fundamental
               feature of neural organization. Recent research has revealed
               that a similar organization exists for the control of motor
               actions, in that each brain hemisphere contributes unique
               control mechanisms to the movements of each arm. The authors
               review present research that addresses the nature of the control
               mechanisms that are lateralized to each hemisphere and how they
               impact motor adaptation and learning. In general, the studies
               suggest an enhanced role for the left hemisphere during
               adaptation, and the learning of new sequences and skills. The
               authors suggest that this specialization emerges from a left
               hemisphere specialization for predictive control-the ability to
               effectively plan and coordinate motor actions, possibly by
               optimizing certain cost functions. In contrast, right hemisphere
               circuits appear to be important for updating ongoing actions and
               stopping at a goal position, through modulation of sensorimotor
               stabilization mechanisms such as reflexes. The authors also
               propose that each brain hemisphere contributes its mechanism to
               the control of both arms. They also discuss the potential

               been reported in previous imaging studies that employed not only
               cognitive, but also motor tasks. However, whether age-related
               reductions in asymmetry of hemispheric activations affect the
               symmetry of motor behavior in older adults remains largely
               untested. We now examine the effect of aging on lateralization
               of motor adaptation and transfer by investigating adaptation to
               novel visuomotor transformations in both old and young age
               groups. We have previously reported substantial asymmetries in
               interlimb transfer of learning these transformations in young
               adults, and attributed these asymmetries in transfer to
               hemispheric lateralization for motor control, as detailed by our
               dynamic dominance hypothesis. Based on the HAROLD model, we
               reasoned that older adults should recruit more symmetrical
               hemispheric activity, and thus show more symmetrical transfer of
               adaptation across the arms. Half of the subjects in each age
               group first adapted to a rotated visual display with the left
               arm, then with the right arm; and the other half in the reversed
               order. Na{\"\i}ve performance with one arm and the same-arm
               performance following opposite arm adaptation were compared to
               determine the extent of transfer in each age group. Our results
               showed that interlimb transfer of initial direction information
               only occurred from the nondominant to dominant arm in young
               adults, whereas it occurred in both directions in older adults.
               Our findings clearly indicate substantially reduced asymmetry in
               visuomotor adaptation in older adults, and suggest that this
               reduced motor asymmetry might be related to diminished
               hemispheric lateralization for motor control.",

  abstract  = "Reaction time (RT) is the time interval between the appearance
               of a stimulus and initiation of a motor response. Within RT, two
               processes occur, selection of motor goals and motor planning. An
               unresolved question is whether perturbation to the motor
               planning component of RT slows the response and alters the
               voluntary activation of muscle. The purpose of this study was to
               determine how the modulation of muscle activity during an RT
               response changes with motor plan perturbation. Twenty-four young
               adults (20.5 $\pm$1.1 yr, 13 women) performed 15 trials of an
               isometric RT task with ankle dorsiflexion using a sinusoidal
               anticipatory strategy (10-20\% maximum voluntary contraction).
               We compared the processing part of the RT and modulation of
               muscle activity from 10 to 60 Hz of the tibialis anterior
               (primary agonist) when the stimulus appeared at the trough or at
               the peak of the sinusoidal task. We found that RT ( P = 0.003)
               was longer when the stimulus occurred at the peak compared with
               the trough. During the time of the reaction, the
               electromyography (EMG) power from 10 to 35 Hz was less at the
               peak than the trough ( P = 0.019), whereas the EMG power from 35
               to 60 Hz was similar between the peak and trough ( P = 0.92).
               These results suggest that perturbation to motor planning
               lengthens the processing part of RT and alters the voluntary
               activation of the muscle by decreasing the relative amount of
               power from 10 to 35 Hz. NEW \& NOTEWORTHY We aimed to determine
               whether perturbation to motor planning would alter the speed and
               muscle activity of the response. We compared trials when a
               stimulus appeared at the peak or trough of an oscillatory

  abstract = "Recent reports of functional impairment in the 'unaffected' limb
              of stroke patients have suggested that these deficits vary with
              the side of lesion. This not only supports the idea that the
              ipsilateral hemisphere contributes to arm movements, but also
              implies that such contributions are lateralized. We have
              previously suggested that the left and right hemispheres are
              specialized for controlling different features of movement. In
              reaching movements, the non-dominant arm appears better adapted
              for achieving accurate final positions and the dominant arm for
              specifying initial trajectory features, such as movement
              direction and peak acceleration. The purpose of this study was to
              determine whether different features of control could
              characterize ipsilesional motor deficits following stroke.
              Healthy control subjects and patients with either left- or
              right-hemisphere damage performed targeted single-joint elbow
              movements of different amplitudes in their ipsilateral hemispace.
              We predicted that left-hemisphere damage would produce deficits
              in specification of initial trajectory features, while
              right-hemisphere damage would produce deficits in final position
              accuracy. Consistent with our predictions, patients with left,
              but not right, hemisphere damage showed reduced modulation of
              acceleration amplitude. However, patients with right, but not
              left, hemisphere damage showed significantly larger errors in
              final position, which corresponded to reduced modulation of
              acceleration duration. Neither patient group differed from
              controls in terms of movement speed. Instead, the mechanisms by
              which speed was specified, through modulation of acceleration
              amplitude and modulation of acceleration duration, appeared to be
              differentially affected by left- and right-hemisphere damage.
              These findings support the idea that each hemisphere contributes
              differentially to the control of initial trajectory and final
              position, and that ipsilesional deficits following stroke reflect
              this lateralization in control.",

  author   = "Sainburg, Robert L",
  abstract = "Handedness is a prominent behavioral phenomenon that emerges from
              asymmetrical neural organization of human motor systems. However,
              the aspects of motor performance that correspond to handedness
              remain largely undetermined. A recent study examining interlimb
              differences in coordination of reaching demonstrated dominant arm
              advantages in controlling limb segment inertial dynamics
              (Sainburg and Kalakanis 2000). Based on these findings, I now
              propose the dynamic-dominance hypothesis, which states that the
              essential factor that distinguishes dominant from nondominant arm
              performance is the facility governing the control of limb
              dynamics. The purpose of this study is to test two predictions of
              this hypothesis: 1) adaptation to novel intersegmental dynamics,
              requiring the development of new dynamic transforms, should be
              more effective for the dominant arm; 2) there should be no
              difference in adapting to visuomotor rotations performed with the
              dominant as compared with the nondominant arm. The latter
              prediction is based on the idea that visual information about
              target position is translated into an internal reference frame
              prior to transformation of the movement plan into dynamic
              properties, which reflect the forces required to produce
              movement. To test these predictions, dominant arm adaptation is
              compared to nondominant arm adaptation during exposure to novel
              inertial loads and to novel visuomotor rotations. The results
              indicate substantial interlimb differences in adaptation to novel
              inertial dynamics, but equivalent adaptation to novel visuomotor
              rotations. Inverse dynamic analysis revealed better coordination
              of dominant arm muscle torques across both shoulder and elbow
              joints, as compared with nondominant arm muscle torques. As a
              result, dominant arm movements were produced with a fraction of
              the mean squared muscle torque computed for nondominant arm
              movements made at similar speeds. These results support the
              dynamic-dominance hypothesis, indicating that interlimb
              asymmetries in control arise downstream to visuomotor
              transformations, when dynamic variables that correspond to the
              forces required for motion are specified.",

              responses based on raw EEG data from 17 studies performed at six
              experimental sites associated with four different institutions.
              The analysis corpus represents 1,155 recordings containing
              approximately 7.8 million event instances acquired under several
              different experimental paradigms. Such large-scale analysis is
              predicated on consistent data organization and event annotation
              as well as an effective automated preprocessing pipeline to
              transform raw EEG into a form suitable for comparative analysis.
              A key component of this analysis is the annotation of
              study-specific event codes using a common vocabulary to describe
              relevant event features. We demonstrate that Hierarchical Event
              Descriptors (HED tags) capture statistically significant
              cognitive aspects of EEG events common across multiple
              recordings, subjects, studies, paradigms, headset configurations,
              and experimental sites. We use representational similarity
              analysis (RSA) to show that EEG responses annotated with the same
              cognitive aspect are significantly more similar than those that
              do not share that cognitive aspect. These RSA similarity results
              are supported by visualizations that exploit the non-linear
              similarities of these associations. We apply temporal overlap
              regression, reducing confounds caused by adjacent event
              instances, to extract time and time-frequency EEG features
              (regressed ERPs and ERSPs) that are comparable across studies and

              use second-level linear regression to separate effects of
              different cognitive aspects on these features across all studies.
              This work demonstrates that EEG mega-analysis (pooling of raw
              data across studies) can enable investigations of brain dynamics
              in a more generalized fashion than single studies afford. A

              addressing commonality of the time and frequency statistical

  abstract = "Previous research suggests that interlimb differences in
              coordination associated with handedness might result from
              specialized control mechanisms that are subserved by different
              cerebral hemispheres. Based largely on the results of horizontal
              plane reaching studies, we have proposed that the hemisphere
              contralateral to the dominant arm is specialized for predictive
              control of limb dynamics, while the non-dominant hemisphere is
              specialized for controlling limb impedance. The current study
              explores interlimb differences in control of 3-D unsupported
              reaching movements. While the task was presented in the
              horizontal plane, participant's arms were unsupported and free to
              move within a range of the vertical axis, which was redundant to
              the task plane. Results indicated significant dominant arm
              advantages for both initial direction accuracy and final position
              accuracy. The dominant arm showed greater excursion along a
              redundant axis that was perpendicular to the task, and parallel
              to gravitational forces. In contrast, the non-dominant arm better
              impeded motion out of the task-plane. Nevertheless, non-dominant
              arm task errors varied substantially more with shoulder rotation
              excursion than did dominant arm task errors. These findings
              suggest that the dominant arm controller was able to take
              advantage of the redundant degrees of freedom of the task, while
              non-dominant task errors appeared enslaved to motion along the
              redundant axis. These findings are consistent with a dominant
              controller that is specialized for intersegmental coordination,
              and a non-dominant controller that is specialized for impedance
              control. However, the findings are inconsistent with previously
              documented conclusions from planar tasks, in which non-dominant
              control leads to greater final position accuracy.",

              question for researchers is how sensitive the results of EEG
              analyses are to preprocessing methods and parameters. To address
              this issue, we analyze the effect of preprocessing methods on
              downstream EEG analysis using several simple signal and
              event-related measures. Signal measures include recording-level
              channel amplitudes, study-level channel amplitude dispersion, and
              recording spectral characteristics. Event-related methods include
              ERPs and ERSPs and their correlations across methods for a
              diverse set of stimulus events. Our analysis also assesses
              differences in residual signals both in the time and spectral

              studies for two ICA-based preprocessing approaches (LARG, MARA)

  abstract = "PURPOSE: EEG is a common diagnostic tool to localize epileptic
              activity with excellent temporal resolution and, however, with
              relatively low spatial resolution. High-density EEG recording is
              limited in clinical practice, mainly because of electrode
              placement difficulties, need of high technical skills, and
              advanced equipment requirement. METHODS: We described the
              technique of long-term EEG recording using a 128-channel neoprene
              cap placed with a dielectric paste in 7 patients with refractory
              epilepsy. We captured electrographic seizures in six of seven
              patients. The 128-channel EEG cap was well tolerated except for a
              mild headache. Daily impedance checks and reapplication of the
              high impedance leads maintained the recording with impedances
              below 10 k$\Omega$. RESULTS: Successful long-term recording of
              high-density EEG was able to capture seizures in six of seven
              patients. The time needed to apply the electrodes was
              approximately 1 hour and approximately 30 minutes daily for
              maintenance. The EEG source localization was obtained in six of
              seven patients, concordant within the sublobar region for both
              standard and high-density EEG recordings. Three patients reported
              a mild headache not leading to discontinuation of the recording.
              CONCLUSIONS: In general, long-term high-density scalp EEG
              recording with a dielectric paste is well tolerated and allows
              capturing both interictal and ictal data for localization. This
              small sample does not show a significant advantage in terms of
              sublobar localization when high-density EEG source is compared
              with standard 10 to 20 placement as long as the subtemporal areas

  abstract = "Motor lateralization in humans has primarily been characterized
              as ``handedness'', resulting in the view that one arm-hemisphere
              system is specialized for all aspects of movement while the other
              is simply a weaker analogue. We have proposed an alternative view
              that motor lateralization reflects proficiency of each arm for
              complementary functions that arises from a specialization of each
              hemisphere for distinct movement control mechanisms. However,
              before this idea of hemispheric specialization can be accepted,
              it is necessary to precisely identify these distinct, lateralized
              mechanisms. Here we show in right-handers that dominant arm
              movements rely on predictive mechanisms that anticipate and
              account for the dynamic properties of the arm, while the
              non-dominant arm optimizes positional stability by specifying
              impedance around equilibrium positions. In a targeted-reaching
              paradigm, we covertly and occasionally shifted the hand starting
              location either orthogonal to or collinear with a particular
              direction of movement. On trials on which the start positions
              were shifted orthogonally, we did not notice any strong interlimb
              differences. However, on trials on which start positions were
              shifted orthogonally, the dominant arm largely maintained the
              direction and straightness of its trajectory, while the
              non-dominant arm deviated towards the previously learned goal
              position, consistent with the hypothesized control specialization
              of each arm-hemisphere system. These results bring together two
              competing theories about mechanisms of movement control, and
              suggest that they coexist in the brain in different hemispheres.
              These findings also question the traditional view of handedness,
              because specialized mechanisms for each arm-hemisphere system
              were identified within a group of right-handers. It is likely
              that such hemispheric specialization emerged to accommodate
              increasing motor complexity during evolution.",

  abstract = "Successful achievement of task goals depends critically on the
              ability to adjust ongoing actions in response to environmental
              changes. The neural substrates underlying action modification
              have been a topic of great controversy: both, posterior parietal
              cortex and frontal regions, particularly prefrontal cortex have
              been previously identified as crucial in this regard, with most
              studies arguing in favor of one or the other. We aimed to address
              this controversy and understand whether frontal and parietal
              regions might play distinct roles during action modification. We
              tested ipsilesional arm performance of 27 stroke patients with
              focal lesions to frontal or parietal regions of the left or right
              cerebral hemisphere, and left or right arm performance of 18
              healthy subjects on the classic double-step task in which a
              target is unpredictably displaced to a new location, requiring
              modification of the ongoing action. Only right hemisphere frontal
              lesions adversely impacted the timing of initiation of the
              modified response, while only left hemisphere parietal lesions
              impaired the accuracy of the modified action. Patients with right
              frontal lesions tended to complete the ongoing action to the
              initially displayed baseline target and initiated the new
              movement after a significant delay. In contrast, patients with
              left parietal damage did not accurately reach the new target
              location, but compared to the other groups, initiated the new
              action during an earlier phase of motion, before their baseline
              action was complete. Our findings thus suggest distinct,
              hemisphere specific contributions of frontal and parietal regions
              to action modification, and bring together, for the first time,
              disparate sets of prior findings about its underlying neural
              substrates.",

              hemisphere-specific motor control and motor learning deficits in
              the ipsilesional, or non-paretic, arm of patients with unilateral
              stroke. We now show across large number and range of stroke
              patients that these motor performance deficits in the non-paretic
              arm of stroke patients vary with both the side of the lesion, as

               important principles that can provide guidelines to
               rehabilitation professionals for enhancing recovery of motor
               function in stroke patients. In this chapter, we elaborate
               principles that have been derived from research on neural
               control of movement, including optimal control, impedance
               control, motor lateralization, and principles of motor learning.
               Research on optimal control has indicated that two major
               categories of cost contribute to motor planning: explicit
               task-level costs, such as movement accuracy and speed, and
               implicit costs, such as energy and movement variability.
               Impedance control refers to neural mechanisms that modulate
               rapid sensorimotor circuits, such as reflexes, in order to
               impede perturbations that cannot be anticipated prior to
               movement. Research on motor lateralization has indicated that
               different aspects of motor control have been specialized to the
               two cerebral hemispheres. This organization leads to
               hemisphere-specific motor deficits in both the ipsilesional and
               contralesional arms of stroke patients. Ipsilesional deficits
               increase with severity of contralesional impairment level and
               have a substantial effect on functional independence. Finally,
               motor learning research has indicated that different neural
               mechanisms underlie different aspects of motor learning, such as
               adaptation vs skill learning, and that learning different
               aspects of tasks can generalize across different coordinates. In
               this chapter, we discuss the neurobiological basis of these
               principles and elaborate the implications for designing and
               implementing occupational and physical therapy treatment for
               movement deficits in stroke patients.",

              in which the hemisphere contralateral to the dominant arm is
              specialized for all aspects of motor control. The present study
              sought to determine which motor lateralization hypothesis best
              predicts motor performance during common bilateral task of
              stabilizing an object (e.g., bread) with one hand while applying
              forces to the object (e.g., slicing) using the other hand. We
              designed an experimental equivalent of this task, performed in a
              virtual environment with the unseen arms supported by
              frictionless air-sleds. The hands were connected by a spring, and
              the task was to maintain the position of one hand while moving
              the other hand to a target. Thus the reaching hand was required
              to take account of the spring load to make smooth and accurate
              trajectories, while the stabilizer hand was required to impede
              the spring load to keep a constant position. Right-handed
              subjects performed two task sessions (right-hand reach and
              left-hand stabilize; left-hand reach and right-hand stabilize)
              with the order of the sessions counterbalanced between groups.
              Our results indicate a hand by task-component interaction such
              that the right hand showed straighter reaching performance
              whereas the left hand showed more stable holding performance.
              These findings provide support for the complementary dominance
              hypothesis and suggest that the specializations of each cerebral

              expressed during bilateral interactive tasks. NEW \& NOTEWORTHY
              We provide evidence for interlimb differences in bilateral

              an advantage for the dominant and nondominant arms for distinct
              features of control. These results provide the first evidence for
              complementary specializations of each limb-hemisphere system for
              different aspects of control within the context of a
              complementary bilateral task.",

  abstract = "We previously demonstrated that lateralization in the neural
              control of predictive and impedance mechanisms is reflected by
              interlimb differences in control of bilateral tasks. Aging has
              been shown to reduce lateralization during unilateral
              performance, presumably due to greater recruitment of the
              ipsilateral hemisphere. We now hypothesize that aging-related
              reduction in neural resources should produce greater behavioral
              asymmetry during bilateral actions that require hemispheric
              specialization for each arm. This is because simultaneous control
              of dominant and non-dominant arm function should induce
              competition for hemisphere-specific resources. To test this
              hypothesis, we now examine the effect of aging (young, N=20; old,
              N=20) on performance of a mechanically coupled task, in which one
              arm reaches toward targets while the other arm stabilizes against
              a spring that connects the two arms. Results indicate better
              dominant arm reaching performance and better non-dominant arm
              stabilizing performance for both groups. Most notably, limb and
              joint compliance was lower in the dominant arm, leading to
              dominant arm deficits in stabilizing performance. Group analysis
              indicated that older adults showed substantially greater
              asymmetry in stabilizing against the spring load than did the
              younger adults. We propose that competition for limited neural
              resources in older adults is associated with reduced
              contributions of right hemisphere mechanisms to right-dominant
              arm stabilizing performance, and thus to greater asymmetry of

  abstract = "When humans walk in everyday life, they typically perform a range

              examining performance changes in dual cognitive-motor tasks
              during walking have produced a variety of results. These

              controlling for walking speed. The goal of this study was to
              determine how young, healthy subjects performed a spatial working
              memory task over a range of walking speeds. We used high-density
              electroencephalography to determine if electrocortical activity
              mirrored changes in cognitive performance across speeds. Subjects
              stood (0.0 m/s) and walked (0.4, 0.8, 1.2, and 1.6 m/s) with and
              without performing a Brooks spatial working memory task. We
              hypothesized that performance of the spatial working memory task
              and the associated electrocortical activity would decrease
              significantly with walking speed. Across speeds, the spatial
              working memory task caused subjects to step more widely compared
              with walking without the task. This is typically a sign that
              humans are adapting their gait dynamics to increase gait
              stability. Several cortical areas exhibited power fluctuations
              time-locked to memory encoding during the cognitive task. In the
              somatosensory association cortex, alpha power increased prior to
              stimulus presentation and decreased during memory encoding. There

              superior parietal lobule and the posterior cingulate cortex
              around memory encoding. However, the subjects did not show a
              significant change in cognitive task performance or
              electrocortical activity with walking speed. These findings
              indicate that in young, healthy subjects walking speed does not
              affect performance of a spatial working memory task. These
              subjects can devote adequate cortical resources to spatial
              cognition when needed, regardless of walking speed.",

              Adaptational changes in performance, reflex activity and muscle
              activation during repetitive obstacle stepping were not reflected
              in the EEG activity, probably due to an insufficient resolution
              of the EEG. The observations suggest that drive from supraspinal

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Electroencephalography (EEG) combined with
               independent component analysis enables functional neuroimaging
               in dynamic environments including during human locomotion. This
               type of functional neuroimaging could be a powerful tool for
               neurological rehabilitation. It could enable clinicians to
               monitor changes in motor control related cortical dynamics
               associated with a therapeutic intervention, and it could
               facilitate noninvasive electrocortical control of devices for
               assisting limb movement to stimulate activity dependent
               plasticity. Understanding the relationship between
               electrocortical dynamics and muscle activity will be helpful for
               incorporating EEG-based functional neuroimaging into clinical
               practice. The goal of this study was to use independent
               component analysis of high-density EEG to test whether we could
               relate electrocortical dynamics to lower limb muscle activation
               in a constrained motor task. A secondary goal was to assess the
               trial-by-trial consistency of the electrocortical dynamics by
               decoding the type of muscle action. METHODS: We recorded
               264-channel EEG while 8 neurologically intact subjects performed
               isometric and isotonic, knee and ankle exercises at two
               different effort levels. Adaptive mixture independent component
               analysis (AMICA) parsed EEG into models of underlying source
               signals. We generated spectrograms for all electrocortical
               source signals and used a na{\"\i}ve Bayesian classifier to
               decode exercise type from trial-by-trial time-frequency data.
               RESULTS: AMICA captured different electrocortical source
               distributions for ankle and knee tasks. The fit of single-trial
               EEG to these models distinguished knee from ankle tasks with
               80\% accuracy. Electrocortical spectral modulations in the
               supplementary motor area were significantly different for
               isometric and isotonic tasks (p < 0.05). Isometric contractions
               elicited an event related desynchronization (ERD) in the
               $\alpha$-band (8-12 Hz) and $\beta$-band (12-30 Hz) at joint
               torque onset and offset. Isotonic contractions elicited a
               sustained $\alpha$- and $\beta$-band ERD throughout the trial.
               Classifiers based on supplementary motor area sources achieved a
               4-way classification accuracy of 69\% while classifiers based on
               electrocortical sources in multiple brain regions achieved a
               4-way classification accuracy of 87\%. CONCLUSIONS: Independent
               component analysis of EEG reveals unique spatial and
               spectro-temporal electrocortical properties for different lower
               limb motor tasks. Using a broad distribution of electrocortical

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: This study characterized the brain electrical
               activity during pedaling, a locomotor-like task, in humans. We
               postulated that phasic brain activity would be associated with
               active pedaling, consistent with a cortical role in locomotor
               tasks. METHODS: Sixty four channels of electroencephalogram
               (EEG) and 10 channels of electromyogram (EMG) data were recorded
               from 10 neurologically-intact volunteers while they performed
               active and passive (no effort) pedaling on a custom-designed
               stationary bicycle. Ensemble averaged waveforms, 2 dimensional
               topographic maps and amplitude of the $\beta$ (13-35 Hz)
               frequency band were analyzed and compared between active and
               passive trials. RESULTS: The peak-to-peak amplitude (peak
               positive-peak negative) of the EEG waveform recorded at the Cz
               electrode was higher in the passive than the active trials (p <
               0.01). $\beta$-band oscillations in electrodes overlying the leg
               representation area of the cortex were significantly
               desynchronized during active compared to the passive pedaling (p
               < 0.01). A significant negative correlation was observed between
               the average EEG waveform for active trials and the composite EMG
               (summated EMG from both limbs for each muscle) of the rectus
               femoris (r = -0.77, p < 0.01) the medial hamstrings (r = -0.85,
               p < 0.01) and the tibialis anterior (r = -0.70, p < 0.01)
               muscles. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated that
               substantial sensorimotor processing occurs in the brain during
               pedaling in humans. Further, cortical activity seemed to be
               greatest during recruitment of the muscles critical for
               transitioning the legs from flexion to extension and vice versa.
               SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first study demonstrating the
               feasibility of EEG recording during pedaling, and owing to
               similarities between pedaling and bipedal walking, may provide

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: In the past few years there has been a growing
              interest in studying brain functioning in natural, real-life
              situations. Mobile EEG allows to study the brain in real
              unconstrained environments but it faces the intrinsic challenge
              that it is impossible to disentangle observed changes in brain
              activity due to increase in cognitive demands by the complex
              natural environment or due to the physical involvement. In this
              work we aim to disentangle the influence of cognitive demands and
              distractions that arise from such outdoor unconstrained
              recordings. APPROACH: We evaluate the ERP and single trial
              characteristics of a three-class auditory oddball paradigm
              recorded in outdoor scenario's while peddling on a fixed bike or
              biking freely around. In addition we also carefully evaluate the
              trial specific motion artifacts through independent gyro
              measurements and control for muscle artifacts. MAIN RESULTS: A
              decrease in P300 amplitude was observed in the free biking
              condition as compared to the fixed bike conditions. Above chance
              P300 single-trial classification in highly dynamic real life
              environments while biking outdoors was achieved. Certain
              significant artifact patterns were identified in the free biking
              condition, but neither these nor the increase in movement (as
              derived from continuous gyrometer measurements) can explain the
              differences in classification accuracy and P300 waveform
              differences with full clarity. The increased cognitive load in
              real-life scenarios is shown to play a major role in the observed
              differences. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings suggest that auditory
              oddball results measured in natural real-life scenarios are
              influenced mainly by increased cognitive load due to being in an
              unconstrained environment.",

              studied using response selection tasks. In these tasks, involving
              very simple motor responses (e.g., button press), errors concern

              sensitive to the magnitude of the error made in a sensorimotor
              adaptation task. In the present study, we tested the function of
              error-related activity in a visuomotor adaptation task. To
              examine whether error size is reflected in the ERP, two groups of
              participants adapted manual aiming movements to either a small
              (30 degrees) or large (45 degrees) rotation of the visual
              feedback display. Each participant's trials were sorted into
              large and small error trials using a median split to examine
              potential error magnitude waveform differences. We also examined
              these trial types at the early and late stages of adaptation.
              There were no group differences for the behavioral or neural
              measures; however, waveforms from large error trials were
              significantly different from small error trials. The waveforms
              also changed as a function of practice as early adaptation
              waveforms were larger than late adaptation waveforms. The
              observed ERP component reflected differences in error magnitude
              with the amount of activity corresponding to the size of the
              error. Movement monitoring potentials likely affected the
              frequency and time course of the waveform so that it did not
              resemble the typical ERN; however, error-related activity was
              still distinguishable. The present findings are discussed in
              terms of current theories of the ERN as well as skill
              acquisition.",

  author   = "Luu, P and Tucker, D M",
  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: Focal electrical fields recorded over the midline
              prefrontal cortex have been found to index rapid evaluative
              decisions, including the recognition of having made an error in a
              speeded response task. The nature of these electrical fields and
              how they are related to cortical areas involved in response
              execution remains to be clarified. METHODS: As subjects performed
              a speeded response task the EEG was recorded with a 128-channel
              sensor array. By filtering out the large slow waves of the
              event-related potential, we found that the error-related
              negativity (Ne/ERN) arises from a midline frontal oscillation
              that alternates with oscillations over lateral sensorimotor
              cortex. Electrical source analyses were used to determine the
              brain sources involved in the generation of these oscillations.
              RESULTS: The results show that the midline and lateral
              oscillations have a period of about 200 ms (theta), and they are
              present for both correct and error responses. When an error is
              made, the midline error oscillation is recruited strongly, and it
              becomes correlated with the motor oscillation. Source analyses
              localized the midline error oscillation to centromedial frontal
              cortex and the lateral oscillation to sensorimotor cortices.
              CONCLUSIONS: Because of the similarity between the midline
              oscillation observed in the present study and frontal midline
              theta, the nature of the Ne/ERN may be clarified by the frontal
              midline theta literature. The correlation between the midline and
              sensorimotor oscillations suggests a possible mechanism for how
              midline frontal evaluative and monitoring networks contribute to
              action regulation.",

              undergoing pre-surgical evaluation for the treatment of epilepsy.
              Performance on the task was associated with a suppression of beta
              (15-30 Hz) frequency oscillation power prior to and just
              following the response and an enhancement of theta (4-8 Hz)

              anatomically distributed towards more dorsal/caudal

              a motor correction. Sensory prediction errors occur when an
              initial motor command is generated but the predicted sensory
              consequences do not match the observed values. In some tasks,

              sensory or on-line motor corrections. Healthy controls and people
              with hereditary cerebellar ataxia reached during a visuomotor

              on-line corrections and ``pointing'' movements that allowed for
              on-line corrections. Sensory (i.e., visual) errors were available

              Cerebellar subjects were comparably impaired in both adaptation

               humans the exact neurobiological mechanisms underlying balance
               control are still unclear. Specifically, although previous
               studies have identified a number of cortical regions that become
               significantly activated during real or imagined balancing, the
               interactions within and between the relevant cortical regions
               remain to be investigated. The working hypothesis of this study
               is that cortical networks contribute to an optimization of
               balance control, and that this contribution can be revealed by
               partial directed coherence-a time-variant, frequency-selective
               and directed functional connectivity analysis tool.
               Electroencephalographic activity was recorded in 37 subjects
               during single-leg balancing on a stable as well as an unstable
               surface. Results of this study show that in the transition from
               balancing on a stable surface to an unstable surface, two
               topographically delimitable connectivity networks (weighted
               directed networks) are established; one associated with the
               alpha and one with the theta frequency band. The theta network
               sequence can be described as a set of subnetworks (modules)
               comprising the frontal, central and parietal cortex with
               individual temporal and spatial developments within and between
               those modules. In the alpha network, the occipital electrodes O1
               and O2 act as a source, and the interactions propagate
               predominantly in the directions from occipital to parietal and
               to centro-parietal areas. These important findings indicate that

              However, most research has focused on reach adjustments following
              changes in target location. This arm research reports two
              categories of online adjustments (see Gaveau et al.,
              Neuropsychologia 55:25-40, 2014 for review). Small, frequently
              undetected, target location shifts invoke fast, automatic
              adjustments, usually without awareness. In contrast, large target
              location shifts can lead to slow, voluntary adjustments. These
              fast and slow adjustments presumably rely on different neural
              networks, with a possible role for subcortical pathways for the
              fast responses. Do leg movement adjustments also fall into these
              two categories? We review the literature on leg movement
              adjustments and show that it is indeed possible to discern fast
              and slow adjustments. More specifically, we provide an overview
              of studies showing adjustments during step preparation,
              initiation, unobstructed, and obstructed gait. Fast adjustments
              were found both during stepping and gait. In the extreme case,
              even step adjustments appear to be further modifiable online,
              e.g., when avoiding obstacles during tripping. In older adults,
              movement adjustments are generally slower and of smaller
              magnitude, consistent with a greater risk of falling. However,
              fast responses seem less affected by aging, consistent with the
              idea of independent parallel mechanisms controlling movement
              adjustments (Gomi, Curr Opin Neurobiol 18:558-567, 2008).

              a cable which held the participant in a forward lean position.
              The magnitude of pre-perturbation cortical activity scaled to
              perturbation amplitude when the magnitude of the perturbation was
              predictable [F(3,11)=2.906, P<0.05]. The amplitude of
              pre-perturbation cortical activity was large when the size of the
              forthcoming perturbation was unknown (13.8 + or - 7.9, 11.4 + or
              - 9.9, 16.9 + or - 9.3, and 16.1 + or - 10.6 muV for the Block
              Unconstrained and Constrained and Random Unconstrained and
              Constrained, respectively). In addition, N1 amplitude scaled to
              perturbation amplitude regardless of whether the size of the
              forthcoming perturbation was known (30.1 + or - 17.7, 11.4 + or -
              7.1, 30.9 + or - 18.4, 12.4 + or - 6.1 muV). This is the first
              work to examine modifiability in the pre-perturbation cortical
              activity related to postural set alterations. The cerebral cortex
              differentially processes independent components prior to and
              following postural instability to generate compensatory responses
              linked to the conditions under which instability is experienced.",

               perturbation of posture have yet to be reported. Ten healthy

               mediated through liquid crystal glasses under two conditions of
               postural demand: quiet standing and quiet sitting. The
               participants' PERs and postural responses were recorded and
               differences between conditions assessed using Wilcoxon
               signed-rank tests. In response to unpredictable visual
               occlusion, both P1 and N1 components of the PER were observed in

               visual occlusion are similar in nature to that seen in relation
               to a physical perturbation. In addition, the amplitude of the N1
               response is not only consistent with the relative magnitude of
               the perturbation, but also the underlying postural set, with a
               larger N1 seen in standing relative to sitting. The study
               informs the relative importance of vision to postural stability,

              assessment of effects of increasing dual-task load (i.e. walking

              suffering dual-task costs. However, participants took longer

              topography of ERP components (N2 and P3) associated with
              inhibitory control between the sitting and walking conditions.
              Considering that participants showed no dual-task performance
              costs, we suggest that observed neural alterations under
              increasing task-load represent adaptive recalibration of the
              inhibitory network towards a more controlled and effortful

               others, is a crucial ability for adaptable and flexible
               behavior. Studies show that specific EEG signatures underpin the
               monitoring of observed erroneous actions (error-related
               negativity, error positivity, mid-frontal theta oscillations).
               However, the majority of studies on action observation used
               sequences of trials where erroneous actions were less frequent
               than correct actions. Therefore, it was not possible to
               disentangle whether the activation of the performance monitoring
               system was due to an error, as a violation of the intended goal,
               or to a surprise/novelty effect, associated with a rare and
               unexpected event. Combining EEG and immersive virtual reality
               (IVR-CAVE system), we recorded the neural signal of 25 young
               adults who observed, in first-person perspective, simple
               reach-to-grasp actions performed by an avatar aiming for a
               glass. Importantly, the proportion of erroneous actions was
               higher than correct actions. Results showed that the observation
               of erroneous actions elicits the typical electrocortical
               signatures of error monitoring, and therefore the violation of
               the action goal is still perceived as a salient event. The
               observation of correct actions elicited stronger alpha
               suppression. This confirmed the role of the alpha-frequency band
               in the general orienting response to novel and infrequent
               stimuli. Our data provide novel evidence that an observed goal
               error (the action slip) triggers the activity of the
               performance-monitoring system even when erroneous actions, which
               are, typically, relevant events, occur more often than correct
               actions and thus are not salient because of their rarity. NEW \&
               NOTEWORTHY Activation of the performance-monitoring system (PMS)
               is typically investigated when errors in a sequence are
               comparatively rare. However, whether the PMS is activated by
               errors per se or by their infrequency is not known. Combining
               EEG-virtual reality techniques, we found that observing frequent
               (70\%) action errors performed by avatars elicits
               electrocortical error signatures suggesting that deviation from
               the prediction of how learned actions should correctly deploy,
               rather than its frequency, is coded in the PMS.",

               cortical activity: both age-related increases and decreases of
               mediofrontal neural activity have been observed and interpreted
               as neural underpinnings of this functional development. To
               better understand this developmental process, we examined EEG
               theta activity in the mediofrontal region using a Go/No-go
               response control task. We found that both pre-stimulus baseline
               theta-power and theta-power during the response control task,
               without baseline-correction, decreased with age. Conversely,
               when task-related theta-power was baseline corrected (using a
               ratio method), it exhibited a positive developmental trajectory.
               The age-related theta-power increase was source-localized to the

               partially mediated age-related improvements in response control

  abstract  = "Recent studies have suggested that individuals can form multiple
               motor memories when simultaneously adapting to multiple, but
               oppositely-oriented perturbations. These findings predict that
               individuals detect the change in learning context, allowing the
               selective initialization and update of motor memories. However,
               previous electrophysiological studies of sensorimotor adaptation
               have not identified a neural mechanism supporting the detection
               of a context switch and adaptation to separate contexts. Here,
               we tested the hypothesis that such a mechanism is identifiable
               through neural oscillations measured through EEG. Human
               participants learned to manipulate an object in two opposite
               contexts (mass distribution). This task was designed based on
               previous work showing that people can adapt to both contexts. We
               found that sensorimotor $\alpha$ and $\beta$, and medial frontal
               $\vartheta$ frequency bands all exhibited different response
               patterns with respect to the error in each context. To determine
               whether any frequency's responses to error were distinctly
               related to a switch in context, we predicted single-trial EEG
               data from a computational learning model that can adapt to
               multiple contexts simultaneously based on a switching mechanism.
               This analysis revealed that only medial frontal $\vartheta$ was
               predicted by a component of the model state that adapts to
               errors based on a context switch. In contrast, $\alpha$ and
               $\beta$ were predicted by a model state that was updated from
               performance errors independent of the context. These findings
               provide novel evidence showing that sensorimotor and medial
               frontal oscillations are predicted by different adaptation
               processes, and that changes in medial frontal activity may
               indicate the formation of motor memories by responding to
               changes in learning context.",

               of human behavioral responses toward action-critical stimuli is
               the spatial correspondence between the stimulus and response

               production is markedly reduced relative to when they mismatch, a
               phenomenon called the Simon effect. While there is a consensus
               that this stimulus-response (S-R) conflict is associated with
               brief (4-7 Hz) frontal midline theta (fm$\vartheta$) complexes
               generated in medial frontal cortex, it remains controversial (1)

               generator areas in the medial frontal cortex that commonly give
               rise to conflict-related fm$\vartheta$ complexes; and if so, (2)
               whether they are all related to the resolution of conflicting

               high-density electroencephalographic measures during a

               analysis and time-frequency domain statistics on source-level
               activities to model fm$\vartheta$ sources. During target
               processing, our results revealed two independent fm$\vartheta$
               generators simultaneously active in or near anterior cingulate
               cortex, only one of them reflecting the correspondence between
               current and previous S-R locations. However, this fm$\vartheta$

               other, conflict-independent processes associated with response
               slowing. These results paint a detailed picture regarding the
               oscillatory correlates of conflict processing in Simon tasks,
               and challenge the prevalent notion that fm$\vartheta$ complexes
               induced by conflicting task information represent a unitary
               phenomenon related to cognitive control, which governs conflict
               processing across various types of response-override
               tasks.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Humans constantly monitor their
               environment for and adjust their cognitive control settings in
               response to conflicts, an ability that arguably paves the way
               for survival in ever-changing situations. Anterior
               cingulate-generated frontal midline theta (fm$\vartheta$)
               complexes have been hypothesized to play a role in this
               conflict-monitoring function. However, it remains a point of
               contention whether fm$\vartheta$ complexes govern conflict
               processing in a unitary, paradigm-nonspecific manner. Here, we
               identified two independent fm$\vartheta$ oscillations triggered
               during a Simon-type task, only one of them reflecting current
               and previous conflicts. Importantly, this signal differed in
               various respects (cortical origin, intertrial history) from
               fm$\vartheta$ phenomena in other response-override tasks,

  abstract  = "Performance errors in conflict tasks often result from
               inappropriate action impulses, and are thought to signal the
               need for increased control over the motor system. However,
               errors may also result from lapses in sustained attention, which
               may require different monitoring and adaptation mechanisms.
               Distinguishing between the mechanisms of adaptation is important
               as both error types may occur intermixed. To this end, we
               measured EEG of healthy human subjects while they performed
               three variants of the Simon task in which errors were more
               likely to occur due to attentional lapses, failures of motor
               control, or both. Behavioral results showed that subjects
               exhibited less conflict effects and less impulsive errors in
               sustained attention compared with the other Simon conditions.
               Time-frequency analyses of EEG data showed that the sustained
               attention Simon condition, compared with the motor control Simon
               condition, was characterized by: (1) less error-related MFC
               theta (4-8 Hz) power and an absence of error-related MFC-DLPFC
               theta phase synchronization; (2) stronger error-related
               suppression of parieto-occipital alpha (8-12 Hz) power and
               stronger parieto-occipital-frontal alpha synchronization. A
               control experiment, using SART (the Sustained Attention to
               Response Test), confirmed that adaptation after attentional
               lapses involved posterior alpha power suppression, in addition
               to inter-regional frontal theta activity. Together, these
               results suggest that at least two cortical mechanisms exist for
               performance monitoring, and that different tasks and
               task-settings can recruit these mechanisms in a different way.
               Post-error brain dynamics thus consist of heterogeneous activity

               (low-beta, high-beta, gamma bands) along with faster, straighter
               reaching movements during both planning and execution. The major
               reduction in coherence (delta, low/high-theta, low/high-alpha
               bands) between Fz and the left prefrontal region during both
               movement planning and execution suggests gradual disengagement
               of frontal executive following its initial role in the
               suppression of established visuomotor maps. Also, change in the
               directionality of phase lags (delta, high-alpha, high-beta,
               gamma bands) reflects a progressive shift from feedback to
               feedforward motor control. The reduction of cortico-cortical
               communication, particularly in the frontal region, and the
               strategic feedback/feedforward mode shift translated as higher
               quality motor performance. This study extends our understanding
               of the role of frontal executive beyond purely cognitive tasks
               to cognitive-motor tasks.",

               small pre-stimulus negative slow wave was present at erroneous

               electrophysiological data recorded with a 30-channel mobile EEG
               montage. We observed an increase of subjective workload and
               decrease of performance with increasing movement complexity.
               Accordingly, we also found a decrease in the parietal P3

              became possible with functional near-infrared spectroscopy
              (fNIRS). So far, little is known about the activations of various
              cortical areas in more complex forms of gait, such as precision
              stepping. From previous work on animals and humans one would
              expect precision stepping to elicit extra activity in the
              sensorimotor cortices (S1/M1), supplementary motor area (SMA), as
              well as in prefrontal cortices (PFC). In the current study,
              hemodynamic changes in the PFC, SMA, M1, and S1 were measured
              with fNIRS. In contrast to previous fNIRS gait studies, the
              technique was optimized by the use of reference channels (to
              correct for superficial hemodynamic interference). Eleven
              subjects randomly performed ten trials of treadmill walking at 3
              km/h (normal walking) and ten trials of 3 km/h treadmill walking
              on predefined spots for the left and right foot presented on the
              treadmill (precision stepping). The walking trials of
              approximately 35 seconds were alternated with rest periods of
              25-35 seconds consisting of quiet standing. The PFC revealed
              profound activation just prior to the onset of both walking
              tasks. There was also extra activation of the PFC during the
              first half of the task period for precision stepping. The SMA
              showed mainly increased activation prior to the start of both
              tasks. In contrast, the sensorimotor cortex did not show a change
              in activation during either task as compared to a condition of
              standing. The SMA, M1, and S1 revealed no significant differences
              between normal walking and precision stepping. It was concluded
              that fNIRS is suited to record the planning and initiation of
              gait. The lack of M1/S1 activation during gait suggests that even
              in the current precision stepping task the control of ongoing
              gait depended mostly on subcortical automatisms, while motor
              cortex contributions did not differ between standing and walking.",

              thought to work in conjunction with lateral prefrontal cortex
              (lPFC) as a part of an action-monitoring network, where errors
              signal the need for increased cognitive control. The neural
              mechanism by which this mPFC-lPFC interaction occurs remains
              unknown. We hypothesized that transient synchronous oscillations
              in the theta range reflect a mechanism by which these structures
              interact. To test this hypothesis, we extracted oscillatory phase
              and power from current-source-density-transformed
              electroencephalographic data recorded during a Flanker task.
              Theta power in the mPFC was diminished on the trial preceding an
              error and increased immediately after an error, consistent with
              predictions of an action-monitoring system. These power dynamics
              appeared to take place over a response-related background of
              oscillatory theta phase coherence. Theta phase synchronization
              between FCz (mPFC) and F5/6 (lPFC) sites was robustly increased

              synchronization predicted the degree of mPFC power on error
              trials, and both of these dynamics predicted the degree of
              posterror reaction time slowing. Oscillatory dynamics in the

              different aspects of a walking experiment, namely the fact that a
              person walks and the rhythmicity of walking. We found that high
              $\gamma$ amplitudes (60-80Hz), located focally in central

              (70-90Hz) amplitudes to be coupled to low $\gamma$ (24-40Hz)

  abstract = "A growing body of evidence indicates a pivotal role of cognition
              and in particular executive function in gait control and fall
              prevention. In a recent gait study using electroencephalographic
              (EEG) imaging, we provided direct proof for cortical top-down
              inhibitory control in step adaptation. A crucial part of motor
              inhibition is recognizing stimuli that signal the need to inhibit
              or adjust motor actions such as steps during walking. One of the
              EEG signatures of performance monitoring in response to events
              signaling the need to adjust motor responses, are error-related
              potential (error-ERP) features. To examine whether error-ERP
              features may index executive control during gait adaptation, we
              analyzed high-density (108-channel) EEG data from an auditory
              gait pacing study. Participants (N = 18) walking on a steadily
              moving treadmill were asked to step in time to an auditory cue
              tone sequence, and then to quickly adapt their step length and
              rate, to regain step-cue synchrony following occasional
              unexpected shifts in the pacing cue train to a faster or slower
              cue tempo. Decomposition of the continuous EEG data by
              independent component analysis revealed a negative deflection in
              the source-resolved event-related potential (ERP) time locked to
              'late' cue tones marking a shift to a slower cue tempo. This
              vertex-negative ERP feature, localized primarily to posterior
              medial frontal cortex (pMFC) and peaking 250 ms after the onset
              of the tempo-shift cue, we here refer to as the step-cue delay
              negativity (SDN). SDN source, timing, and polarity resemble other
              error-related ERP features, e.g., the Error-Related Negativity
              (ERN) and Feedback-Related Negativity (FRN) in (seated) button
              press response tasks. In single trials, SDN amplitude varied with
              the magnitude of the cue latency deviation (the time interval
              between the expected and actual cue onsets). Regression analysis
              also identified linear coupling between SDN amplitude and the
              subsequent speed of gait tempo adaptation (as measured by the
              increase in length of the ensuing adaptation step). The SDN in
              this paradigm thus seems both to index the perceived need for and
              the subsequent magnitude of the immediate gait adjustment,
              consistent with performance-monitoring models. Future research
              might investigate relationships of these control processes to the
              impairment of gait adjustment in motor disorders and cognitive
              decline, for example to develop a biomarker for fall risk

  abstract = "In robot assisted gait training, a pattern of human locomotion is
              executed repetitively with the intention to restore the motor
              programs associated with walking. Several studies showed that
              active contribution to the movement is critical for the encoding
              of motor memory. We propose to use brain monitoring techniques
              during gait training to encourage active participation in the
              movement. We investigated the spectral patterns in the
              electroencephalogram (EEG) that are related to active and passive
              robot assisted gait. Fourteen healthy participants were
              considered. Infomax independent component analysis separated the
              EEG into independent components representing brain, muscle, and
              eye movement activity, as well as other artifacts. An equivalent
              current dipole was calculated for each independent component.
              Independent components were clustered across participants based
              on their anatomical position and frequency spectra. Four clusters
              were identified in the sensorimotor cortices that accounted for
              differences between active and passive walking or showed activity
              related to the gait cycle. We show that in central midline areas
              the mu (8-12 Hz) and beta (18-21 Hz) rhythms are suppressed
              during active compared to passive walking. These changes are
              statistically significant: mu (F(1, 13)=11.2 p $\leq$ 0.01) and
              beta (F(1, 13)=7.7, p $\leq$ 0.05). We also show that these
              differences depend on the gait cycle phases. We provide first
              evidence of modulations of the gamma rhythm in the band 25 to 40
              Hz, localized in central midline areas related to the phases of
              the gait cycle. We observed a trend (F(1, 8)=11.03, p $\leq$
              0.06) for suppressed low gamma rhythm when comparing active and
              passive walking. Additionally we found significant suppressions
              of the mu (F(1, 11)=20.1 p $\leq$ 0.01), beta (F(1, 11)=11.3 p
              $\leq$ 0.05) and gamma (F(1, 11)=4.9 p $\leq$ 0.05) rhythms near
              C3 (in the right hand area of the primary motor cortex) during
              phases of active vs. passive robot assisted walking. To our
              knowledge this is the first study showing EEG analysis during
              robot assisted walking. We provide evidence for significant
              differences in cortical activation between active and passive
              robot assisted gait. Our findings may help to define appropriate
              features for single trial detection of active participation in
              gait training. This work is a further step toward the evaluation
              of brain monitoring techniques and brain-computer interface
              technologies for improving gait rehabilitation therapies in a
              top-down approach.",

               from spinal and supraspinal centers in neurologically intact
               participants. The purpose of this study was to test the
               hypothesis that following a cerebrovascular accident, shared
               systems from interlimb cutaneous networks facilitating arm and
               leg coordination persist across locomotor tasks. Twelve stroke
               participants (>6 months post CVA) performed arm and leg (A\&L)
               cycling using a stationary ergometer and walking on a motorized
               treadmill. In both tasks cutaneous reflexes were evoked via
               surface stimulation of the nerves innervating the dorsum of the
               hand (superficial radial; SR) and foot (superficial peroneal;
               SP) of the less affected limbs. Electromyographic (EMG) activity
               from the tibialis anterior, soleus, flexor carpi radialis, and
               posterior deltoid were recorded bilaterally with surface
               electrodes. Full-wave rectified and filtered EMG data were
               separated into eight equal parts or phases and aligned to begin
               with maximum knee extension for both walking and A\&L cycling.
               At each phase of movement, background EMG data were quantified
               as the peak normalized response for each participant and
               cutaneous reflexes were quantified as the average cumulative
               reflex over 150 ms following stimulation. In general, background
               EMG was similar between walking and A\&L cycling, seen
               especially in the distal leg muscles. Cutaneous reflexes were
               evident and modified in the less and more affected limbs during
               walking and A\&L cycling and similar modulation patterns were
               observed suggesting activity in related control networks between
               tasks. After a stroke common neural patterning from conserved
               subcortical regulation is seen supporting the notion of a common
               core in locomotor tasks involving arm and leg movement. This has
               translational implications for rehabilitation where A\&L cycling
               could be usefully applied to improve walking function.",

  author    = "Palomino, Andres F and Hundza, Sandra R and Zehr, E Paul",
  abstract  = "During rhythmic arm cycling, soleus H-reflex amplitudes are
               reduced by modulation of group Ia presynaptic inhibition. This
               suppression of reflex amplitude is graded to the frequency of
               arm cycling with a threshold of 0.8 Hz. Despite the data on
               modulation of the soleus H-reflex amplitude induced by rhythmic
               arm cycling, comparatively little is known about the modulation
               of stretch reflexes due to remote limb movement. Therefore, the
               present study was intended to explore the effect of arm cycling
               on stretch and H-reflex amplitudes in the soleus muscle. In so
               doing, additional information on the mechanism of action during
               rhythmic arm cycling would be revealed. Although both reflexes
               share the same afferent pathway, we hypothesized that stretch
               reflex amplitudes would be less suppressed by arm cycling
               because they are less inhibited by presynaptic inhibition.
               Failure to reject this hypothesis would add additional strength
               to the argument that Ia presynaptic inhibition is the mechanism
               modulating soleus H-reflex amplitude during rhythmic arm
               cycling. Participants were seated in a customized chair with
               feet strapped to footplates. Three motor tasks were performed:
               static control trials and arm cycling at 1 and 2 Hz. Soleus
               H-reflexes were evoked using single 1 ms pulses of electrical
               stimulation delivered to the tibial nerve at the popliteal
               fossa. A constant M-wave and ~6\% MVC activation of soleus were
               maintained across conditions. Stretch reflexes were evoked using
               a single sinusoidal pulse at 100 Hz given by a vibratory shaker
               placed over the triceps surae tendon and controlled by a
               custom-written LabView program. Results demonstrated that
               rhythmic arm cycling that was effective for conditioning soleus
               H-reflexes did not show a suppressive effect on the amplitude of
               the soleus stretch reflex. We suggest this indicates that
               stretch reflexes are less sensitive to conditioning by rhythmic
               arm movement, as compared to H-reflexes, due to the relative
               insensitivity to Ia presynaptic inhibition.",

              induce changes in electrocortical activity. Ten healthy adults
              (21-36 years) were asked to walk overground in three different
              conditions: (1) normal walking in a straight path (NW); (2)
              walking in a pre-defined pathway forcing variation in step width
              and length by stepping on green marks on the floor (only one
              color: W1C), and (3) walking in the same pre-defined W1C pathway
              while evaluating different combinations among the colors green,
              yellow and red, in which only one color was the footfall target
              (evaluating two colors: W2C). Walking speed, stride duration and
              scalp electroencephalography (EEG) were recorded from all
              conditions. Event-related spectral perturbation was calculated
              for channels Fz, Cz, C3, C4, Pz and Oz in each condition, which
              were all time-normalized in relation to the gait cycle. The

              was increased for W2C when compared to both NW and W1C (p <
              0.01). Moreover, Event-related spectral perturbation analysis
              revealed significant changes (p < 0.05) during mid-stance in the
              frontal lobe and motor/sensorimotor regions, a phase in the gait

              demands during precision stepping influences electrocortical

              we recorded ground reaction forces (GRFs) and high-density scalp

              component (IC) processes and then computed equivalent current
              dipoles for each IC. We clustered cortical source ICs and
              analyzed event-related spectral perturbations synchronized to
              gait events. Our results indicated that walking with eyes closed
              reduced the first peak of the vertical GRFs and induced shorter
              stride duration. Regarding the EEG, we found that walking with
              eyes closed induced significantly increased relative theta
              desynchronization in the frontal and premotor cortex during
              stance, as well as greater desynchronization from theta to beta
              bands during transition to single support for both left and right
              somatosensory cortex. These results suggest a phase-specific

              Gait kinematics and high density electroencephalography (EEG)
              were recorded whilst walking around a university campus.
              Conditions with dual tasks were accompanied by decreased gait

              resonance imaging (fMRI)]. Separate and distinct
              activation/deactivation patterns were found for the three
              imagined conditions: (1) standing imagery was associated with
              activation in the thalamus, basal ganglia, and cerebellar vermis;
              (2) walking imagery was associated with activation in the
              parahippocampal and fusiform gyri (areas involved in visuospatial
              navigation), occipital visual areas, and in the cerebellum; (3)
              running imagery caused a predominantly cerebellar activation in
              the vermis and adjacent hemispheres (six times larger than during
              imagination of walking or standing), but activations in the
              parahippocampal and fusiform gyri were smaller than during
              walking. Deactivations were found for walking and running, but
              not for standing imagery. They were located in the vestibular
              (posterior insula, superior temporal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus)
              and somatosensory (postcentral gyrus) cortex with
              right-hemispheric dominance. These findings support the concept
              of a hierarchical organization of posture and locomotion.
              Automated locomotion, for example, running, is based on spinal
              generators whose pace is driven by the cerebellar locomotor
              region. Deactivation in the vestibular and somatosensory cortex
              prevents adverse interactions with the optimized spinal pattern
              and sensory signals; this confirms earlier findings of a
              multisensory inhibition during unhindered locomotion. During slow
              walking, spatial navigation, mediated by the parahippocampal
              cortex, becomes more important. Postural control during standing
              involves a low intensity cerebellar activity and sensorimotor
              control via the thalamus and basal ganglia.",

               movements such as treadmill walking, over-ground walking and
               other locomotive and non-locomotive tasks. Unfortunately, MoBI
               protocols are prone to physiological and non-physiological
               artifacts, including motion artifacts that may contaminate the

               Fourier analysis and wavelet coherence approaches. Contrary to
               prior claims, the subjects' motion did not significantly affect
               their EEG during treadmill walking although precaution should be
               taken when gait speeds approach 4.5 km/h. Overall, these

               resisting rather than assisting leg swing during treadmill
               training. Ten subjects with incomplete SCI were recruited into
               this study for two treadmill training sessions: one using swing
               resistance and the other using swing assistance during treadmill
               stepping. A controlled resistance/assistance was provided to the
               subjects' right knee using a customized cable-driven robot. The
               subjects' spatial and temporal parameters were recorded during
               the training. The same parameters during overground walking were
               also recorded before and after the training session using an
               instrumented walkway. Results indicated that stride length
               during treadmill stepping increased following the release of
               resistance load and the aftereffect transferred to overground
               walking. In contrast, stride length during treadmill stepping
               decreased following the release of assistance load, but the
               aftereffect did not transfer to overground walking. Providing
               swing resistance during treadmill training could enhance the
               active involvement of the subjects in the gait motor task,
               thereby aiding in the transfer to overground walking. Such a
               paradigm may be useful as an adjunct approach to improve the
               locomotor function in patients with incomplete SCI.",

               separate functional networks controlling forward and backward

               the complex and long-lasting and is a requirement for successful
               mobility in an unpredictable environment. Several neural
               structures, including the spinal cord, brainstem, cerebellum,
               and motor cortex, have been implicated in the control of various

               structures control which types of adaptation and the specific
               mechanisms by which the appropriate adjustments are made. Here,
               we used a splitbelt treadmill to test cerebellar contributions

               found that cerebellar damage does not impair the ability to make
               reactive feedback-driven motor adaptations, but significantly
               disrupts predictive feedforward motor adaptations during
               splitbelt treadmill locomotion. Our results speak to two
               important aspects of locomotor control. First, we have
               demonstrated that different levels of locomotor adaptability are
               clearly dissociable. Second, the cerebellum seems to play an
               essential role in predictive but not reactive locomotor
               adjustments. We postulate that reactive adjustments may instead

  abstract = "Many studies have examined the rapid stopping of action as a
              proxy of human self-control. Several methods have shown that a
              critical focus for stopping is the right inferior frontal cortex.
              Moreover, electrocorticography studies have shown beta band power
              increases in the right inferior frontal cortex and in the BG for
              successful versus failed stop trials, before the time of stopping
              elapses, perhaps underpinning a prefrontal-BG network for
              inhibitory control. Here, we tested whether the same signature
              might be visible in scalp electroencephalography (EEG)-which
              would open important avenues for using this signature in studies
              of the recruitment and timing of prefrontal inhibitory control.
              We used independent component analysis and time-frequency
              approaches to analyze EEG from three different cohorts of healthy
              young volunteers (48 participants in total) performing versions
              of the standard stop signal task. We identified a spectral power
              increase in the band 13-20 Hz that occurs after the stop signal,
              but before the time of stopping elapses, with a right frontal

              significantly larger for successful compared with failed stops in
              two of the three studies. We also tested the hypothesis that
              unexpected events recruit the same frontal system for stopping.
              Indeed, we show that the stopping-related right-lateralized
              frontal beta signature was also active after unexpected events
              (and we accordingly provide data and scripts for the method).
              These results validate a right frontal beta signature in the EEG

  abstract = "UNLABELLED: Everyday locomotion and obstacle avoidance requires
              effective gait adaptation in response to sensory cues. Many
              studies have shown that efficient motor actions are associated
              with $\mu$ rhythm (8-13 Hz) and $\beta$ band (13-35 Hz) local
              field desynchronizations in sensorimotor and parietal cortex,
              whereas a number of cognitive task studies have reported higher
              behavioral accuracy to be associated with increases in $\beta$
              band power in prefrontal and sensory cortex. How these two
              distinct patterns of $\beta$ band oscillations interplay during
              gait adaptation, however, has not been established. Here we
              recorded 108 channel EEG activity from 18 participants (10 males,
              22-35 years old) attempting to walk on a treadmill in synchrony
              with a series of pacing cue tones, and quickly adapting their
              step rate and length to sudden shifts in pacing cue tempo.
              Independent component analysis parsed each participant's EEG data
              into maximally independent component (IC) source processes, which
              were then grouped across participants into distinct
              spatial/spectral clusters. Following cue tempo shifts, mean
              $\beta$ band power was suppressed for IC sources in central
              midline and parietal regions, whereas mean $\beta$ band power
              increased in IC sources in or near medial prefrontal and
              dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In the right dorsolateral
              prefrontal cortex IC cluster, the $\beta$ band power increase was
              stronger during (more effortful) step shortening than during step
              lengthening. These results thus show that two distinct patterns
              of $\beta$ band activity modulation accompany gait adaptations:
              one likely serving movement initiation and execution; and the
              other, motor control and inhibition. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT:
              Understanding brain dynamics supporting gait adaptation is
              crucial for understanding motor deficits in walking, such as
              those associated with aging, stroke, and Parkinson's. Only a few
              electromagnetic brain imaging studies have examined neural
              correlates of human upright walking. Here, application of
              independent component analysis to EEG data recorded during
              treadmill walking allowed us to uncover two distinct $\beta$ band
              oscillatory cortical networks that are active during gait
              adaptation to shifts in the tempo of an auditory pacing cue:
              (8-13 Hz) $\mu$ rhythm and (13-35 Hz) $\beta$ band power
              decreases in central and parietal cortex and (14-20 Hz) $\beta$
              band power increases in frontal brain areas. These results
              provide a fuller framework for electrophysiological studies of
              cortical gait control and its disorders.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used by
              clinicians, scientists, engineers and other professionals
              worldwide, with an increasing number of low-cost,
              commercially-oriented EEG systems that have become available in
              recent years. One such system is the Cognionics Quick-20
              (Cognionics Inc., San Diego, USA), which uses dry electrodes and
              offers the convenience of portability thanks to its built-in
              amplifier and wireless connection. Because of such
              characteristics, this system has been used in several
              applications for both clinical and basic research studies.
              However, an investigation of the quality of the signals that are
              recorded using this system has not yet been reported. APPROACH:
              To bridge this gap, here we conducted a systematic comparison of
              signal quality between the Cognionics Quick-20 system and the
              Brain Products actiCAP/actiCHamp (Brain Products GmbH, Munich,
              Germany), a state-of-the-art, wet-electrode, research-oriented
              EEG system. Resting-state EEG data were recorded from twelve
              human participants at rest in eyes open and eyes closed
              conditions. For both systems we evaluated the similarity of mean
              recorded power spectral density, and detection of alpha
              suppression associated with eyes open relative to eyes closed.
              MAIN RESULTS: Power spectral densities were highly correlated
              across systems, with only minor topographical variability across
              the scalp. Both systems recorded alpha suppression during eyes
              open relative to eyes closed conditions. SIGNIFICANCE: These
              results attest to the robustness and reliability of the
              dry-electrode Cognionics system relatively to the widely used
              Brain Products laboratory EEG system, and thus validate its
              utility for clinical and basic research purposes, at least in
              studies in which participants do not move.",

              One version of REST is closely integrated into EEGLAB, which is a

              the left mastoid (M) reference, three data sets were generated by
              re-referencing to the conventional linked mastoids (L), average
              (A) and the new 'infinity' (I) reference provided by the
              reference electrode standardization technique (REST, Yao 2001
              Physiol. Meas. 22 693-711). The EEG power in the alpha frequency
              band with the four different references was calculated and
              compared with respect to the total energy and spatial amplitude
              weight centre (AWC) coordinates, to compare the effects of
              different references on power mapping in the frequency domain.
              Compared with the I reference, the AWCs of the EEG with the M
              reference show significant shifts to the right, frontal and
              superficial positions, the L reference significant shifts to
              frontal and superficial positions, and the A reference shifts the
              AWC significantly to a deeper position. Furthermore, the power
              maps of the M and L references have larger total power than the I
              reference, while that of the A reference has the smallest total
              power. These results confirm that different choices of reference
              electrodes result in systematic changes in the distribution of
              EEG frequency power, and in order to reduce the effect of such
              systematic shifts on the explanation of EEG mappings, a common

              the EEG data of 30 unipolar depressed subjects and 30 age-matched
              healthy controls were recorded. The EEG data were analyzed in

              the nodes for each channel pair, were calculated. An ML scheme

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Several scalp EEG functional connectivity studies,
              mostly clinical, seem to overlook the reference electrode impact.
              The subsequent interpretation of brain connectivity is thus often
              biased by the choice of a non-neutral reference. This study aims
              at systematically investigating these effects. APPROACH: As EEG
              reference, we examined the vertex electrode (Cz), the digitally
              linked mastoids (DLM), the average reference (AVE), and the
              reference electrode standardization technique (REST). As a
              connectivity metric, we used the imaginary part of the coherency.
              We tested simulated and real data (eyes-open resting state) by
              evaluating the influence of electrode density, the effect of head
              model accuracy in the REST transformation, and the impact on the
              characterization of the topology of functional networks from
              graph analysis. MAIN RESULTS: Simulations demonstrated that REST
              significantly reduced the distortion of connectivity patterns
              when compared to AVE, Cz, and DLM references. Moreover, the
              availability of high-density EEG systems and an accurate
              knowledge of the head model are crucial elements to improve REST
              performance, with the individual realistic head model being
              preferable to the standard realistic head model. For real data, a
              systematic change of the spatial pattern of functional
              connectivity depending on the chosen reference was also observed.
              The distortion of connectivity patterns was larger for the Cz
              reference, and progressively decreased when using the DLM, the
              AVE, and the REST. Strikingly, we also showed that network
              attributes derived from graph analysis, i.e. node degree and
              local efficiency, are significantly influenced by the EEG
              reference choice. SIGNIFICANCE: Overall, this study highlights
              that significant differences arise in scalp EEG functional
              connectivity and graph network properties, in dependence on the
              chosen reference. We hope that our study will convey the message
              that caution should be used when interpreting and comparing
              results obtained from different laboratories using different
              reference schemes.",

  abstract = "The effect of an active reference in EEG recording is one of the
              oldest technical problems in EEG practice. In this paper, a
              method is proposed to approximately standardize the reference of
              scalp EEG recordings to a point at infinity. This method is based
              on the fact that the use of scalp potentials to determine the
              neural electrical activities or their equivalent sources does not
              depend on the reference, so we may approximately reconstruct the
              equivalent sources from scalp EEG recordings with a scalp point
              or average reference. Then the potentials referenced at infinity
              are approximately reconstructed from the equivalent sources. As a
              point at infinity is far from all the possible neural sources,
              this method may be considered as a reference electrode

              effective for the most important superficial cortical region and
              the standardization could be especially important in recovering

              This unsettled problem still inspires unceasing debate. The ideal

              unfortunately it is well known that no point on the body fulfills

              provide application-oriented principled recommendations. In this
              paper current popular references are classified into two
              categories: (1) unipolar references that construct a neutral
              reference, including both online unipolar references and offline
              re-references. Examples of unipolar references are the reference
              electrode standardization technique (REST), average reference
              (AR), and linked-mastoids/ears reference (LM); (2) non-unipolar
              references that include the bipolar reference and the Laplacian
              reference. We show that each reference is derived with a
              different assumption and serves different aims. We also note from
              (Hu et al. 2019) that there is a general form for the reference
              problem, the 'no memory' property of the unipolar references, and
              a unified estimator for the potentials at infinity termed as the
              regularized REST (rREST) which has more advantageous statistical
              evidence than AR. A thorough discussion of the advantages and
              limitations of references is provided with recommendations in the

              compensatory functional posterior-to-anterior shift, which
              contributes to maintenance of cognitive performance when
              posterior cortical function is impaired. Alternatively, the
              increased prefrontal activity may be less efficient or less

              Instead, we used a novel, model-based multivariate analysis

              adult-lifespan human sample (N = 123 and N = 115; approximately

              The results contradict the hypothesis of a compensatory

              specificity rather than compensation.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
              Functional brain imaging studies have often shown increased
              activity in prefrontal brain regions in older adults. This has
              been proposed to reflect a compensatory shift to greater reliance
              on prefrontal cortex (PFC), helping to maintain cognitive
              function. Alternatively, activity may become less specific as
              people age. This is a key question in the neuroscience of aging.
              In this study, we used novel tests of how different brain regions
              contribute to long- and short-term memory. We found increased
              activity in PFC in older adults, but this activity carried less
              information about memory outcomes than activity in visual
              regions. These findings are relevant for understanding why
              cognitive abilities decline with age, suggesting that optimal
              function depends on successful brain maintenance rather than
              compensation.",

              body. This capacity is studied in the laboratory through
              sensorimotor adaptation paradigms imposing sustained and
              predictable motor demands specific to the task at hand. However,
              these studies are tied to the laboratory setting. Thus, we asked
              if a portable device could be used to elicit locomotor adaptation
              outside the laboratory. To this end we tested the extent to which
              a pair of motorized shoes could induce similar locomotor
              adaptation to split-belt walking, which is a well-established
              sensorimotor adaptation paradigm in locomotion. We specifically
              compared two groups of young, healthy subjects adapted on the
              treadmill by moving their feet at different speeds with a
              split-belt treadmill or with a pair of motorized shoes. We found
              that the adaptation of joint motions and measures of spatial and
              temporal asymmetry, which are commonly used to quantify
              sensorimotor adaptation in locomotion, were indistinguishable
              between groups. We only found small differences in the join angle

              due to the relatively large weight and height of the motorized
              shoes. Our results indicate that robust sensorimotor adaptation
              in walking can be induced with a paired of motorized shoes,

  abstract = "Newly learned motor skills are initially labile and then
              consolidated to permit retention. The circuits that enable the
              consolidation of motor memories remain uncertain. Most work to
              date has focused on primary motor cortex, and although there is
              ample evidence of learning-related plasticity in motor cortex,
              direct evidence for its involvement in memory consolidation is
              limited. Learning-related plasticity is also observed in
              somatosensory cortex, and accordingly, it may also be involved in
              memory consolidation. Here, by using transcranial magnetic
              stimulation (TMS) to block consolidation, we report the first
              direct evidence that plasticity in somatosensory cortex
              participates in the consolidation of motor memory. Participants
              made movements to targets while a robot applied forces to the
              hand to alter somatosensory feedback. Immediately following
              adaptation, continuous theta-burst transcranial magnetic
              stimulation (cTBS) was delivered to block retention; then,
              following a 24-hour delay, which would normally permit
              consolidation, we assessed whether there was an impairment. It
              was found that when mechanical loads were introduced gradually to
              engage implicit learning processes, suppression of somatosensory
              cortex following training almost entirely eliminated retention.
              In contrast, cTBS to motor cortex following learning had little
              effect on retention at all; retention following cTBS to motor
              cortex was not different than following sham TMS stimulation. We
              confirmed that cTBS to somatosensory cortex interfered with
              normal sensory function and that it blocked motor memory
              consolidation and not the ability to retrieve a consolidated
              motor memory. In conclusion, the findings are consistent with the
              hypothesis that in adaptation learning, somatosensory cortex
              rather than motor cortex is involved in the consolidation of
              motor memory.",

              evidence suggests that habit formation and relearning of habits
              operate in a context-dependent manner: Habit formation is
              promoted when actions are performed in a specific context, while
              breaking off habits is facilitated after a context change. It is
              an open question how one can computationally model the brain9s
              balancing between context-specific habits and goal-directed
              actions. Here, we propose a hierarchical Bayesian approach for
              control of a partially observable Markov decision process that
              enables conjoint learning of habit and reward structure in a
              context-specific manner. In this model, habit learning
              corresponds to a value-free updating of priors over policies and
              interacts with the value-based learning of the reward structure.
              Importantly, the model is solely built on probabilistic
              inference, which effectively provides a simple explanation how
              the brain may balance contributions of habitual and goal-directed

              simulated experiments, where we replicated several findings of

              a single parameter, the so-called habitual tendency, can explain
              individual differences in habit learning and the balancing
              between habitual and goal-directed control. Finally, we discuss

              of these individuals is one of the key points that should be
              considered before implementing any gait intervention protocol.
              The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of
              stroke on intralimb gait coordination of the lower limbs using a
              vector coding technique. Twenty-five individuals with stroke and
              18 non-disabled individuals (control), between 46 and 71 years
              old, participated in this study. A computerized analysis system
              registered data from reflective markers placed on specific body
              landmarks to define thigh, shank, and foot of both body sides, as
              participants walked at self-selected comfortable speed.
              Coordination modes, such as in-phase, anti-phase,
              proximal-segment-phase, and distal-segment-phase, and variability
              of thigh-shank, and shank-foot were analyzed for the paretic,
              non-paretic and control limbs during the stance and swing
              periods, and the entire gait cycle using the vector coding
              technique. During the stance period, individuals with stroke
              presented higher frequency of thigh-phase and lower frequency of
              shank-phase for the thigh-shank coupling and higher frequency of
              shank-phase for the shank-foot coupling compared to non-disabled
              controls, indicating that the proximal segment of each pair leads
              the movement. During the swing period, the paretic limb presented
              higher frequency for in-phase than non-paretic and control limbs
              for the thigh-shank coupling. Adaptations in the non-paretic limb
              were observed in the swing period, with higher frequency than
              paretic and control limbs in the thigh-phase for the thigh-shank
              coupling, and higher frequency than the paretic limb in the
              foot-phase for the shank-foot coupling. No differences in
              coordination variability were found between paretic, non-paretic,
              and control limbs. The vector coding technique constitutes a
              useful tool for identifying gait alterations in intralimb
              coordination of individuals with stroke. Our coordination results
              demonstrate a shift from distal to more proximal control during
              the stance phase in both legs for the individuals with stroke and
              an inability to decouple segment coordination during the swing
              phase in the paretic limb. The results indicate that it is more
              suitable to consider the stance and swing periods separately
              instead of considering the entire gait cycle to investigate
              intralimb gait coordination of individuals with stroke.",

              increased binding between sensory cortices through coherent gamma
              oscillations. We tested this hypothesis by applying 4-in-1
              multi-electrode transcranial alternating current stimulation
              (tACS) with 40 Hz over visual and somatosensory cortices. In
              phase stimulation (0°) was expected to strengthen binding and
              thereby enhance the congruence effect, while anti-phase (180°)
              stimulation was expected to have opposite effects. Gamma tACS was
              controlled by alpha (10 Hz) and sham stimulation, as well as by
              applying tACS unilaterally while visual-tactile stimuli were
              presented lateralized. Contrary to our expectations, gamma tACS
              over the relevant hemisphere delayed responses to congruent
              trials. Additionally, reanalysis of EEG data revealed decoupling
              of sensory gamma oscillations during congruent trials. We propose
              that gamma tACS prevented sensory decoupling and thereby limited
              the congruence effect. Together, our results favor the
              perspective that processing multisensory congruence involves
              corticocortical communication rather than feature binding.
              Furthermore, we found control stimulation over the irrelevant
              hemisphere to speed responses under alpha stimulation and to
              delay responses under gamma stimulation, consistent with the idea
              that contralateral alpha/gamma dynamics regulate cortical
              excitability.",

  abstract = "Electroencephalography (EEG) and source estimation can be used to
              identify brain areas activated during a task, which could offer
              greater insight on cortical dynamics. Source estimation requires
              knowledge of the locations of the EEG electrodes. This could be
              provided with a template or obtained by digitizing the EEG
              electrode locations. Operator skill and inherent uncertainties of
              a digitizing system likely produce a range of digitization
              reliabilities, which could affect source estimation and the
              interpretation of the estimated source locations. Here, we
              compared the reliabilities of five digitizing methods
              (ultrasound, structured-light 3D scan, infrared 3D scan, motion
              capture probe, and motion capture) and determined the
              relationship between digitization reliability and source
              estimation uncertainty, assuming other contributors to source
              estimation uncertainty were constant. We digitized a mannequin
              head using each method five times and quantified the reliability
              and validity of each method. We created five hundred sets of
              electrode locations based on our reliability results and applied
              a dipole fitting algorithm (DIPFIT) to perform source estimation.
              The motion capture method, which recorded the locations of
              markers placed directly on the electrodes had the best
              reliability with an average electrode variability of 0.001 cm.
              Then, in order of decreasing reliability were the method using a
              digitizing probe in the motion capture system, an infrared 3D
              scanner, a structured-light 3D scanner, and an ultrasound
              digitization system. Unsurprisingly, uncertainty of the estimated
              source locations increased with greater variability of EEG
              electrode locations and less reliable digitizing systems. If EEG
              electrode location variability was ∽1 cm, a single source could
              shift by as much as 2 cm. To help translate these distances into
              practical terms, we quantified Brodmann area accuracy for each
              digitizing method and found that the average Brodmann area
              accuracy for all digitizing methods was >80\%. Using a template
              of electrode locations reduced the Brodmann area accuracy to
              ∽50\%. Overall, more reliable digitizing methods can reduce
              source estimation uncertainty, but the significance of the source
              estimation uncertainty depends on the desired spatial resolution.
              For accurate Brodmann area identification, any of the digitizing
              methods tested can be used confidently.",

              consequences, which are reinforced during the sleep consolidation

              inputs and motor outputs are necessary for the maintenance of
              intact brain organization. Motor Imagery (MI), which corresponds
              to the mental representation of movement without its actual
              execution, is known to significantly activate motor networks,
              even when overt movement are no longer possible. Whether MI might
              rapidly compensate the maladaptive neuroplasticity elicited by
              immobilization remains however a working hypothesis, which has
              received far less attention. Here, we investigated the potential
              benefits of MI practice during 12 hr of unilateral
              arm-immobilization on the sensorimotor and cortical
              representations of the arms, as well as during subsequent sleep.
              Using a within-subject design, fourteen participants were first
              tested after a normal day of motor activity (without
              immobilization, NoImmo), followed by two randomized 12 hr
              conditions separated by 1 week, whereby their right (dominant)
              arm was immobilized either with MI practice 15 min every two
              hours (ImMI), or without MI (ImCtrl). After each daytime
              condition, participants were tested on a hand laterality judgment
              task to assess changes in the sensorimotor representation of the
              hands, followed by the measure of cortical excitability over both
              primary motor cortices (M1). Polysomnography recordings were also
              monitored overnight to investigate the sleep-related
              consolidation effects. Data revealed that MI practice prevented
              i) the slow-down in the sensorimotor representation of hands, ii)
              the cortical excitability depression over the M1 contralateral to
              arm-immobilization, iii) the sleep spindles reduction over both
              M1s, and iv) extended the time spent in REM sleep. Altogether,
              these results provide strong evidence that implementing MI within
              the context of limb-immobilization contributes to substantially
              limit the deleterious effect of disuse, and may further promote
              recovery of motor function.",

              respect to behavioral, neurological, and neuroimaging findings.
              Previous behavioral research investigating the influence of aging
              on motor learning has consistently reported the following
              results. First, the initial acquisition of motor sequences is not
              altered, except under conditions of increased task complexity.
              Second, older adults demonstrate deficits in motor sequence
              memory consolidation. And, third, although older adults
              demonstrate deficits during the exposure phase of MA paradigms,
              the aftereffects following removal of the sensorimotor
              perturbation are similar to young adults, suggesting that the
              adaptive ability of older adults is relatively intact. This paper
              will review the potential neural underpinnings of these

              premovement EEG decoding. Eight participants performed 30 types

              The findings further revealed that direction and distance may
              provide the largest contributions to movement. In addition,
              regardless of the parameter, useful features for classification

               morbidities and all-cause mortality. Analysis of the literature
               focusing on key exercise variables (e.g., intensity, type, and
               volume) suggests that the requisite beneficial amount of
               activity is that which engenders improved cardiorespiratory
               fitness, strength, power, and, indirectly, balance. Age-related
               declines in these components are such that physical limitations
               impinge on functional activities of daily living. However, an
               exercise programme can minimize declines, thus preventing older
               adults (age 65+ years) from crossing functional thresholds of
               inability. Cross-sectional and longitudinal data demonstrate
               that cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with functional
               capacity and independence; strength and, importantly, power are
               related to performance and activities of daily living; and
               balance-mobility in combination with power are important factors
               in preventing falls. Exercise interventions have documented that
               older adults can adapt physiologically to exercise training,
               with gains in functional capacities. The few studies that have
               explored minimal or optimal activity requirements suggest that a
               threshold (intensity) within the moderately vigorous domain is
               needed to achieve and preserve related health benefits. Thus,
               physical activity and (or) exercise prescriptions should

               components related to the maintenance of functional capacity and
               independence; these will also delay morbidity and mortality. An
               appropriate recommendation for older adults includes moderately
               vigorous cardiorespiratory activities (e.g., brisk walking),
               strength and (or) power training for maintenance of muscle mass
               and specific muscle-group performance, as well as

               randomized, sequential order: (a) a resistance-based,
               reciprocal, affected leg locomotor training protocol using the
               NuStep apparatus (n = 4) and (b) a home exercise programme (HEP)
               consisting of self-supervised practice with fractionated joint
               movements of the lower limb. Each phase of the intervention was
               performed for 30 minutes each session, three days a week, and
               conducted over an eight-week period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
               Outcomes were evaluated by a blinded rater using the lower
               extremity scale of the Fugl-Meyer and the Berg Balance Scale.
               RESULTS: After HEP participation, subjects showed nominal or no
               changes on any of the outcome measures. After NuStep
               participation, patients in both treatment groups showed
               impairment reductions as shown by the Fugl-Meyer (+4.3; +2.2),
               and increased balance as shown by the Berg Balance Scale (+4.0;
               +4.0). These trends were exhibited regardless of group
               assignment. CONCLUSION: Impairment reductions and balance gains
               may be achieved using a resistance-based, reciprocal upper and
               lower limb locomotor training protocol.",

  abstract = "Human walking is highly adaptable, which allows us to walk under
              different circumstances. With aging, the probability of falling
              increases, which may partially be due to a decreased ability of
              older adults to adapt the gait pattern to the needs of the
              environment. The literature on visuomotor adaptations during
              reaching suggests, however, that older adults have little
              problems in adapting their motor behavior. Nevertheless, it may
              be that adaptation during a more complex task like gait is
              compromised by aging. In this study, we investigated the ability
              of young (n = 8) and older (n = 12) adults to adapt their gait
              pattern to novel constraints with a split-belt paradigm. Findings
              revealed that older adults adapted less and more slowly to
              split-belt walking and showed fewer aftereffects than young
              adults. While young adults showed a fast adjustment of the
              relative time spent in swing for each leg older adults failed to
              do so, but instead they were very fast in manipulating swing
              speed differences between the two legs. We suggest that these
              changes in adaptability of gait due to aging stem from a mild
              degradation of cortico-cerebellar pathways (reduced adaptability)
              and cerebral structures (decreased ability to change gait cycle
              timing). However, an alternative interpretation may be that the
              observed reduced adaptation is a compensatory strategy in view of
              the instability induced by the split-belt paradigm.",

              decline in neural distinctiveness of spatial information. Here,
              we asked whether neural tuning functions of walking direction are
              broadened in older versus younger adults. To test this idea, we
              developed a novel method that allowed us to investigate changes
              in fMRI-measured pattern similarity while participants navigated
              in different directions in a virtual spatial navigation task. We
              expected that directional tuning functions would be broader in
              older adults, and thus activation patterns that reflect
              neighboring directions would be less distinct as compared to
              non-adjacent directions. Because loss of distinctiveness leads to
              more confusions when information is read out by downstream areas,
              we analyzed predictions of a decoder trained on these
              representations and asked (1) whether decoder confusions between
              two directions increase proportionally to their angular
              similarity, (2) and how this effect may differ between age
              groups. Evidence for tuning-function-like signals was found in
              the retrosplenial complex and primary visual cortex. Significant
              age differences in tuning width, however, were only found in the

              information could lead to worse directional signals in older

              behavior. Instead, directional information encoded in RSC

  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: after stroke a typical presentation is exaggerated
              stretch reflexes (SRs) on the more affected (MA) side. The
              present study evaluated the contribution of presynaptic
              inhibition (PSI) induced by arm cycling and homosynaptic
              depression (HD) to the modulation of hyperreflexia at the ankle
              after stroke. Possible asymmetry of these effects between the MA
              and less affected (LA) legs was also assessed. METHODS: soleus SR
              was conditioned by: arm cycling at 1 Hz (to increase Ia PSI); or,
              a preceding conditioning tendon tap applied 1 s before the test
              stimulus (to induce HD). The extent of conditioning effects was
              compared between the MA and the LA legs. RESULTS: for both MA and
              LA legs, rhythmic arm movement induced a bidirectional effect in
              different participants, either increasing or decreasing SR
              amplitude (p < 0.05). HD had a significant effect in both legs (p
              < 0.05), however, the effect of both a previous muscle stretch
              and arm cycling was not different between the MA and the LA legs.
              CONCLUSION: our data reveal a bidirectional reflex modulation
              induced by arm cycling that produced facilitation in some and
              suppression in other participants after stroke. Relative SR
              amplitude modulation did not differ between the LA and MA legs.
              We speculate that alterations in SR amplitude modulation after
              stroke may reflect specific changes in both presynaptic afferent
              transmission mechanisms and fusimotor control. SIGNIFICANCE: the

              measurement instruments used in research are reviewed. SUMMARY:
              Key indicators of the quality of a measuring instrument are the
              reliability and validity of the measures. The process of
              developing and validating an instrument is in large part focused
              on reducing error in the measurement process. Reliability
              estimates evaluate the stability of measures, internal
              consistency of measurement instruments, and interrater
              reliability of instrument scores. Validity is the extent to which
              the interpretations of the results of a test are warranted, which
              depends on the particular use the test is intended to serve. The
              responsiveness of the measure to change is of interest in many of
              the applications in health care where improvement in outcomes as
              a result of treatment is a primary goal of research. Several
              issues may affect the accuracy of data collected, such as those
              related to self-report and secondary data sources. Self-report of
              patients or subjects is required for many of the measurements
              conducted in health care, but self-reports of behavior are
              particularly subject to problems with social desirability biases.
              Data that were originally gathered for a different purpose are
              often used to answer a research question, which can affect the
              applicability to the study at hand. CONCLUSION: In health care
              and social science research, many of the variables of interest
              and outcomes that are important are abstract concepts known as
              theoretical constructs. Using tests or instruments that are valid
              and reliable to measure such constructs is a crucial component of

              inter-observer variability of the registration of bony landmarks
              and alignment axes on a Computed Axial Tomography (CT) scan. Six
              cadaver specimens were scanned. Three-dimensional surface models
              of the knee were created. Three observers marked anatomic surface
              landmarks and alignment landmarks. The intra- and inter-observer
              variability of the point and axis registration was performed.
              Mean intra-observer precision ranks around 1 mm for all
              landmarks. The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) for
              inter-observer variability ranked higher than 0.98 for all
              landmarks. The highest recorded intra- and inter-observer
              variability was 1.3 mm and 3.5 mm respectively and was observed
              for the lateral femoral epicondyle. The lowest variability in the
              determination of axes was found for the femoral mechanical axis
              (intra-observer 0.12 degrees and inter-observer 0.19 degrees) and
              for the tibial mechanical axis (respectively 0.15 degrees and
              0.28 degrees). In the horizontal plane the lowest variability was
              observed for the posterior condylar line of the femur

              variability in the CT registration of landmarks that define the
              coordinate system of the femur and the tibia. In the femur, the
              horizontal plane projections of the posterior condylar line and
              the surgical and anatomical transepicondylar axis can be
              determined precisely on a CT scan, using the described
              methodology. In the tibia, the best result is obtained for the
              tibial transverse axis.",

              investigated how the reliability of cortical thickness

              including scanner field strength, manufacturer, upgrade and pulse
              sequence. Several data processing factors were also studied. Two
              test-retest data sets were analyzed: 1) 15 healthy older subjects
              scanned four times at 2-week intervals on three scanners; 2) 5
              subjects scanned before and after a major scanner upgrade.
              Within-scanner variability of global cortical thickness
              measurements was <0.03 mm, and the point-wise standard deviation
              of measurement error was approximately 0.12 mm. Variability was
              0.15 mm and 0.17 mm in average, respectively, for cross-scanner
              (Siemens/GE) and cross-field strength (1.5 T/3 T) comparisons.
              Scanner upgrade did not increase variability nor introduce bias.
              Measurements across field strength, however, were slightly biased
              (thicker at 3 T). The number of (single vs. multiple averaged)
              acquisitions had a negligible effect on reliability, but the use
              of a different pulse sequence had a larger impact, as did
              different parameters employed in data processing. Sample size
              estimates indicate that regional cortical thickness difference of
              0.2 mm between two different groups could be identified with as
              few as 7 subjects per group, and a difference of 0.1 mm could be
              detected with 26 subjects per group. These results demonstrate
              that MRI-derived cortical thickness measures are highly reliable
              when MRI instrument and data processing factors are controlled
              but that it is important to consider these factors in the design
              of multi-site or longitudinal studies, such as clinical drug

              The primary goals of this study were to: (1) assess the
              feasibility of extracting electrocortical signals from scalp EEG
              while performing sustained, physically demanding dual-task
              walking and (2) test hypotheses about how the P300 event-related
              potential is affected by walking physical exertion. Participants
              walked on a treadmill for an hour either carrying an empty
              rucksack or one filled with 40\% of their body weight. During the
              walking conditions and during a seated control condition,
              subjects periodically performed a visual oddball task. We
              recorded scalp EEG and examined electrocortical dynamics
              time-locked to the target stimulus. Channel-level event-related
              potential analysis demonstrated that it is feasible to extract
              reliable signals during long duration loaded walking. P300
              amplitude was reduced during loaded walking versus seated, but
              there was no effect of time on task. Source level activity and
              frequency analysis revealed that sensorimotor, parietal, and
              cingulate brain areas all contributed to the reduced P300
              amplitude during dual-task walking. We interpret the results as
              supporting a prioritization of cortical resources for walking,
              leading to fewer resources being directed toward the oddball task
              during dual-task locomotion.",

              body weight support (BWS), and recumbent stepping using a

              upper and lower limb electromyography patterns between conditions
              revealed high correlations for most muscles. A principal

              Cross correlation analysis found a high correlation between
              factors for recumbent stepping and walking (R = 0.54), though not
              as high as the correlation between factors for walking at 0\% BWS

  abstract = "We have extensively used arm cycling to study the neural control
              of rhythmic movements such as arm swing during walking. Recently
              rhythmic movement of the arms has also been shown to enhance and
              shape muscle activity in the legs. However, restricted
              information is available concerning the conditions necessary to
              maximally alter lumbar spinal cord excitability. Knowledge on the
              neuromechanics of a task can assist in the determination of the
              type, level, and timing of neural signals, yet arm swing during
              walking and arm cycling have not received a detailed
              neuromechanical comparison. The purpose of this research was to
              provide a combined neural and mechanical measurement approach
              that could be used to assist in the determination of the
              necessary and sufficient conditions for arm movement to assist in
              lower limb rehabilitation after stroke and spinal cord injury.
              Subjects performed three rhythmic arm movement tasks: (1) cycling
              (cycle); (2) swinging while standing (swing); and (3) swinging
              while treadmill walking (walk). We hypothesized that any
              difference in neural control between tasks (i.e., pattern of
              muscle activity) would reflect changes in the mechanical
              constraints unique to each task. Three-dimensional kinematics
              were collected simultaneously with force measurement at the hand
              and electromyography from the arms and trunk. All data were
              appropriately segmented to allow a comparison between and across
              conditions and were normalized and averaged to 100\% movement
              cycle based on shoulder excursion. Separate mathematical
              principal components analysis of kinematic and neural variables
              was performed to determine common task features and muscle
              synergies. The results highlight important neural and mechanical
              features that distinguish differences between tasks. For example,
              there are considerable differences in the anatomical positions of
              the arms during each task, which relate to the moments
              experienced about the elbow and shoulder. Also, there are
              differences between tasks in elbow flexion/extension kinematics
              alongside differential muscle activation profiles. As well,
              mechanical assistance and constraints during all tasks could
              affect muscle recruitment and the functional role of muscles.
              Overall, despite neural and mechanical differences, the results
              are consistent with conserved common central motor control
              mechanisms operational for cycle, walk, and swing but
              appropriately sculpted to demands unique to each task. However,
              changing the mechanical parameters could affect the role of
              afferent feedback altering neural control and the coupling to the
              lower limbs.",

              with multiple cortical areas specialised for sensory recognition
              or motor execution. Although there has been considerable research
              into sensorimotor control in humans, the steps between sensory
              recognition and motor execution are not fully understood. To
              provide insight into brain areas responsible for sensorimotor
              computation, we used complex categorization-response tasks
              (variations of a Stroop task requiring recognition,
              decision-making, and motor responses) to test the hypothesis that
              some functional modules are participating in both sensory as well
              as motor processing. We operationalize functional modules as
              independent components (ICs) yielded by an independent component
              analysis (ICA) of EEG data and measured event-related responses
              by means of inter-trial coherence (ITC). Our results consistently
              found ICs with event-related ITC responses related to both
              sensory stimulation and motor response onsets (on average 5.8 ICs
              per session). These findings reveal EEG correlates of tightly
              coupled sensorimotor processing in the human brain, and support
              frameworks like embodied cognition, common coding, and
              sensorimotor contingency that do not sequentially separate

              the placement of a high number (64-256) of EEG electrodes. Here,
              we describe the cranio-cerebral correlations with the 10-10

              automated algorithm which enables the projection of electrode
              positions onto the cortical surface, we studied the cortical
              projections in 16 healthy subjects using the Talairach
              stereotactic system and estimated the variability of cortical
              projections in a statistical way. We found that the cortical
              projections of the 10-10 system could be estimated with a grand
              standard deviation of 4.6 mm in x, 7.1 mm in y and 7.8 mm in z.

              in the central region and parietal lobe and least in the frontal

               Researchers have decoded hand position, velocity, and
               acceleration during center-out reaching or drawing tasks from
               neural recordings acquired invasively at the microscale and

               magnetoencephalography (MEG) data acquired from the scalp during
               a center-out drawing task with an imposed hand-cursor rotation.
               The grand mean (n=5) correlation coefficients (CCs) between
               measured and decoded velocity profiles were 0.48, 0.40, 0.38,

               0.49, 0.56, and 0.23 for the vertical dimension of movement

               early-exposure, late-exposure, and post-exposure to the
               hand-cursor rotation. By projecting the sensor contributions to
               decoding onto whole-head scalp maps, we found that a macroscale

               between the predicted and actual visual consequences of the
               movement). One reason for this is that PEs tend to be associated

               input, making them difficult to isolate. Here this issue is

               counter a 45° visuomotor rotation, was compared to a condition

               hypothesized that central commands may change the size and

               zones are used by the nervous system and how they may be changed

               responses to sudden unloading of the elbow flexors in

               postural control deficits due to unilateral hemispheric and/or
               subcortical lesions. By studying responses in patients, we
               sought to determine whether the specification of zones of
               agonist/antagonist muscle coactivation (``coactivation zones'')
               may be essential for postural stability. At an initial elbow
               angle (130 degrees; full extension is 180 degrees), flexors were
               pre-activated by compensating an initial load which was equal to
               approximately 30\% of the subject's maximal isometric voluntary
               contraction effort. Subjects were instructed not to correct the
               arm displacement elicited by a sudden decrease in the load. Data
               from 10 trials were collected at each of 4-6 final load levels
               (separated by 1.5-2 Nm) in order to map out the relationship
               between torque and angle in each subject. The procedure was
               repeated from a more flexed initial position of the elbow (100
               degrees). EMG activity from two elbow flexors and two elbow
               extensors, as well as torque, velocity and joint position were
               recorded. Healthy control subjects and patients with mild
               clinical symptoms had coactivation zones or small silent zones
               around the final positions established after unloading. In these
               subjects, final positions of the limb were stable. Voluntary
               movement, i.e., transition of the limb from one initial position
               to another, was associated with a change in the location of the
               zone in articular space. The presence of large silent zones in
               patients with moderate or severe symptoms was correlated with
               postural instability and oscillations about the final position
               of the arm after unloading. The comparison of results from
               healthy and hemiparetic subjects implies that the central
               specification of the size and the location of a coactivation
               zone may be fundamental for the control of posture and movement.",

               three different levels of difficulty, brain activity was
               measured before these movements. To classify the levels of
               difficulty, we extracted event-related spectrum perturbation
               (ERSP) data and performed classification using a relevance
               vector machine (RVM). Single-trial classification using ERSP
               data could not obtain high classification accuracy. However,
               classification accuracies using averaged-trial ERSP data were

               voluntary movement, its role in sensorimotor adaptation remains
               largely uncertain. Recently, it has been shown that the
               post-movement beta rebound as well as beta activity during
               movement-preparation are modulated by movement errors. However,
               there are critical functional differences between pre- and
               post-movement beta activities. Here, we addressed two related
               open questions. Do the pre- and post-movement error-related
               modulations arise from distinct neural substrates? Do these
               modulations relate to efferent signals shaping muscle-activation
               patterns or do they reflect integration of sensory information,
               intervening upstream of the motor output? For this purpose,
               first we exploited independent component analysis (ICA) which
               revealed a double dissociation suggesting that distinct neural
               substrates are recruited in error-related beta-power modulations
               observed before and after movement. Second, we compared
               error-related beta oscillation responses observed in two
               bimanual reaching tasks involving similar movements but
               different interlimb coordination, and in which the same
               mechanical perturbations induced different behavioral adaptive
               responses. While the task difference was not reflected in the
               post-movement beta rebound, the pre-movement beta activity was
               differently modulated according to the interlimb coordination.
               Critically, we show an uncoupling between the behavioral and the
               electrophysiological responses during the movement preparation
               phase, which demonstrates that the error-related modulation of
               the foreperiod beta activity does not reflect changes in the
               motor output from primary motor cortex. It seems instead to
               relate to higher level processing of sensory afferents,
               essential for sensorimotor adaptation.",

  abstract  = "Temporal independent component analysis (ICA) is applied to an
               electrophysiological signal mixture (such as an EEG recording)
               to disentangle the independent neural source signals-independent
               components-underlying said signal mixture. When applied to scalp
               EEG, ICA is most commonly used either as a pre-processing step
               (e.g., to isolate physiological processes from non-physiological
               artifacts), or as a data-reduction step (i.e., to focus on one
               specific neural process with increased signal-to-noise ratio).
               However, ICA can be used in an even more powerful way that
               fundamentally expands the inferential utility of scalp EEG. The
               core assumption of EEG-ICA-namely, that individual independent
               components represent separable neural processes-can be leveraged
               to derive the following inferential logic: If a specific
               independent component shows activity related to multiple
               psychological processes within the same dataset (e.g., elicited
               by different experimental events), it follows that those
               psychological processes involve a common, non-separable neural
               mechanism. As such, this logic allows testing a class of
               hypotheses that is beyond the reach of regular EEG analyses
               techniques, thereby crucially increasing the inferential utility
               of the EEG. In the current article, this logic will be referred
               to as the 'common independent process identification' (CIPI)
               approach. This article aims to provide a tutorial into the
               application of this powerful approach, targeted at researchers
               that have a basic understanding of standard EEG analysis.
               Furthermore, the article aims to exemplify the usage of CIPI by
               outlining recent studies that successfully applied this approach

               perturbations. Although responses to postural perturbations
               occur more quickly than the fastest voluntary movements, they
               have longer latencies than spinal stretch reflexes, suggesting
               greater potential for modification by the cortex. Postural
               responses include short, medium and long latency components of
               muscle activation with increasing involvement of the cerebral
               cortex as latencies increase. Evidence suggests that the cortex
               is also involved in changing postural responses with alterations
               in cognitive state, initial sensory-motor conditions, prior
               experience, and prior warning of a perturbation, all
               representing changes in ``central set.'' Studies suggest that
               the cerebellar-cortical loop is responsible for adapting
               postural responses based on prior experience and the basal
               ganglia-cortical loop is responsible for pre-selecting and

               responses both directly via corticospinal loops and shorter
               latency postural responses indirectly via communication with the
               brainstem centers that harbor the synergies for postural
               responses, thereby providing both speed and flexibility for

               While the patterns preceding brisk voluntary movements, and
               especially movement execution, are well described, there are few
               EEG studies that address the cortical activation patterns seen
               in isometric exertions and their planning. In this paper, we
               report on time and time-frequency EEG signatures in experiments
               in normal subjects (n=8), using multichannel EEG during motor
               preparation, planning and execution of directional centre-out
               arm isometric exertions performed at the wrist in the horizontal
               plane, in response to instruction-delay visual cues. Our
               observations suggest that isometric force exertions are
               accompanied by transient and sustained event-related potentials
               (ERP) and event-related (de-)synchronisations (ERD/ERS),
               comparable to those of a movement task. Furthermore, the ERPs
               and ERD/ERS are also observed during preparation and planning of
               the isometric task. Comparison of ear-lobe-referenced and
               surface Laplacian ERPs indicates the contribution of superficial
               sources in supplementary and pre-motor (FC(z)), parietal (CP(z))
               and primary motor cortical areas (C₁ and FC₁) to ERPs (primarily
               negative peaks in frontal and positive peaks in parietal areas),
               but contribution of deep sources to sustained time-domain
               potentials (negativity in planning and positivity in execution).
               Transient and sustained ERD patterns in $\mu$ and $\beta$
               frequency bands of ear-lobe-referenced and surface Laplacian EEG
               indicate the contribution of both superficial and deep sources
               to ERD/ERS. As no physical displacement happens during the task,
               we can infer that the underlying mechanisms of motor-related
               ERPs and ERD/ERS patterns do not only depend on change in limb
               coordinate or muscle-length-dependent ascending sensory
               information and are primary generated by motor preparation,

               step frequency that makes walking less costly. Although aspects

              quantify the errors made by healthy young and elderly individuals
              in their perceptions of force produced at the knee. Four
              different tasks were used to evaluate the perception of force and
              the effect of a sensory-motor reference and simultaneous
              contraction on the accuracy of perception. The absolute errors
              were similar between groups, with values of 11.9\% to 16.3\%,
              depending on the task. The raw perception errors were greater for
              high levels of force (>50\% of the maximal voluntary contraction,
              or MVC), indicating an overestimation of the forces produced for
              both groups. At 70\% MVC, the sensory-motor reference reduced raw
              perception errors, and the simultaneous contraction improved the
              accuracy of force production. Healthy young and elderly
              individuals had about the same capacity to judge the muscular
              force of their knee extensors. Therapists involved in the

              the Motor Learning System",
  author   = "Albert, Scott T and Shadmehr, Reza",
  abstract = "UNLABELLED: When we experience an error during a movement, we
              update our motor commands to partially correct for this error on
              the next trial. How does experience of error produce the
              improvement in the subsequent motor commands? During the course
              of an erroneous reaching movement, proprioceptive and visual
              sensory pathways not only sense the error, but also engage
              feedback mechanisms, resulting in corrective motor responses that
              continue until the hand arrives at its goal. One possibility is
              that this feedback response is co-opted by the learning system
              and used as a template to improve performance on the next
              attempt. Here we used electromyography (EMG) to compare neural
              correlates of learning and feedback to test the hypothesis that
              the feedback response to error acts as a template for learning.
              We designed a task in which mixtures of error-clamp and
              force-field perturbation trials were used to deconstruct EMG time
              courses into error-feedback and learning components. We observed
              that the error-feedback response was composed of excitation of
              some muscles, and inhibition of others, producing a complex
              activation/deactivation pattern during the reach. Despite this
              complexity, across muscles the learning response was consistently
              a scaled version of the error-feedback response, but shifted 125
              ms earlier in time. Across people, individuals who produced a
              greater feedback response to error, also learned more from error.
              This suggests that the feedback response to error serves as a
              teaching signal for the brain. Individuals who learn faster have
              a better teacher in their feedback control system. SIGNIFICANCE
              STATEMENT: Our sensory organs transduce errors in behavior. To
              improve performance, we must generate better motor commands. How
              does the nervous system transform an error in sensory coordinates
              into better motor commands in muscle coordinates? Here we show
              that when an error occurs during a movement, the reflexes
              transform the sensory representation of error into motor
              commands. To learn from error, the nervous system scales this
              feedback response and then shifts it earlier in time, adding it
              to the previously generated motor commands. This addition serves
              as an update to the motor commands, constituting the learning
              signal. Therefore, by providing a coordinate transformation, the
              feedback system generates a template for learning from error.",

              ambiguous sensory information to form accurate perceptions about
              the outside world. This local-to-global problem is also
              fundamental to motor control of the arm, because complex
              mechanical interactions between shoulder and elbow allow a
              particular amount of motion at one joint to arise from an
              infinite combination of shoulder and elbow torques. Here we show,
              in humans and rhesus monkeys, that a transcortical pathway
              through primary motor cortex (M1) resolves this ambiguity during
              fast feedback control. We demonstrate that single M1 neurons of
              behaving monkeys can integrate shoulder and elbow motion
              information into motor commands that appropriately counter the
              underlying torque within about 50 milliseconds of a mechanical
              perturbation. Moreover, we reveal a causal link between M1
              processing and multi-joint integration in humans by showing that
              shoulder muscle responses occurring ∼50 milliseconds after pure

              provides neurophysiological support for influential theories

              tradition in neurology and psychology. More recently, the motor
              system has been subject to quantitative and computational
              characterization. The purpose of this review is to argue that the
              lesion approach and theoretical motor control can mutually inform
              each other. Specifically, one may identify distinct motor control
              processes from computational models and map them onto specific
              deficits in patients. Here we review some of the impairments in
              motor control, motor learning and higher-order motor control in
              patients with lesions of the corticospinal tract, the cerebellum,
              parietal cortex, the basal ganglia, and the medial temporal lobe.
              We attempt to explain some of these impairments in terms of
              computational ideas such as state estimation, optimization,
              prediction, cost, and reward. We suggest that a function of the
              cerebellum is system identification: to build internal models
              that predict sensory outcome of motor commands and correct motor
              commands through internal feedback. A function of the parietal
              cortex is state estimation: to integrate the predicted
              proprioceptive and visual outcomes with sensory feedback to form
              a belief about how the commands affected the states of the body
              and the environment. A function of basal ganglia is related to
              optimal control: learning costs and rewards associated with
              sensory states and estimating the ``cost-to-go'' during execution
              of a motor task. Finally, functions of the primary and the
              premotor cortices are related to implementing the optimal control
              policy by transforming beliefs about proprioceptive and visual
              states, respectively, into motor commands.",

              when prisms alter visual feedback or a force field alters limb
              dynamics), called execution errors. Execution errors may be
              caused by miscalibration of dynamics (e.g., when a force field
              alters limb dynamics) or by miscalibration of kinematics (e.g.,
              when prisms alter visual feedback). Although all types of errors

              structured-light 3D scanner for EEG electrode digitization. We
              tested its accuracy, robustness and evaluated its practical
              feasibility. Furthermore, we assessed how 3D scanning of EEG
              electrode positions affects the accuracy of EEG volume conduction
              models and source localization. NEW METHOD: To assess the
              improvement in electrode positions and source results, we
              compared the electrode positions both at the scalp level and by
              quantifying source model accuracy between the 3D scanner, generic
              template, and cap-specific electrode positions. RESULTS AND
              COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: The use of the 3D scanner
              significantly improves the accuracy of EEG electrode positions to
              a median error of 9.4 mm and maximal error of 32.8 mm, relative
              to the custom (median error of 10.9 mm, maximal error 39.1 mm)
              and manufacturer's template positions (median error of 13.8 mm,

              the EEG source model averaged over the brain improves from 0.18

              the EEG source model accuracy. It is more affordable than systems
              currently used for this, and allows for robust and fast

               reaching movements towards a visual target have to be performed.
               In contrast, those transformations are not needed for similar,
               but non-visually guided, arm movements. According to previous
               studies, these transformations are carried out by neuronal
               populations located in the parietal and frontal cortical areas
               (the so-called ``dorsal visual stream''). However, it is still
               debated whether these processes are mediated by the sequential
               and/or parallel activation of the frontoparietal areas. To
               investigate this issue, we designed a task where the same visual
               cue could represent either the target of a reaching/pointing
               movement or the go-signal for a similar but non-targeting arm
               movement. By subtracting the event-related potentials (ERPs)
               recorded from healthy subjects performing the two conditions, we
               identified the brain processes underlying the visuomotor
               transformations needed for accurate reaching/pointing movements.
               We then localized the generators by means of cortical current
               density (CCD) reconstruction and studied their dynamics from
               visual cue presentation to movement onset. The results showed
               simultaneous activation of the parietal and frontal areas from
               140 to 260 ms. The results are interpreted as neural correlates
               of two critical phases of visuomotor integration, namely target
               selection and movement selection. Our findings suggest that the
               visuomotor transformation processes required for correct
               reaching/pointing movements do not rely on a purely sequential
               activation of the frontoparietal areas, but mainly on a parallel
               information processing system, where feedback circuits play an
               important role before movement onset.",

               movement. This work investigates the potential use of brain
               signals recorded non-invasively for detecting the time before a
               self-paced reaching movement is initiated which could contribute
               to the design of practical upper limb neuroprosthetics. In
               particular, we show the detection of self-paced reaching
               movement intention in single trials using the readiness
               potential, an electroencephalography (EEG) slow cortical
               potential (SCP) computed in a narrow frequency range (0.1-1 Hz).
               Our experiments with 12 human volunteers, two of them stroke
               subjects, yield high detection rates prior to the movement onset
               and low detection rates during the non-movement intention
               period. With the proposed approach, movement intention was
               detected around 500 ms before actual onset, which clearly
               matches previous literature on readiness potentials.
               Interestingly, the result obtained with one of the stroke
               subjects is coherent with those achieved in healthy subjects,
               with single-trial performance of up to 92\% for the paretic arm.
               These results suggest that, apart from contributing to our
               understanding of voluntary motor control for designing more
               advanced neuroprostheses, our work could also have a direct
               impact on advancing robot-assisted neurorehabilitation.",

              correlation for all conditions, while being prone to similar

              wet EEG systems commonly used in clinical or research

              of electrodes application speed, subject comfort, and most
              critically electrophysiological signal quality between the
              conventional and wired Biosemi EEG system using wet active
              electrodes and the compact and wireless F1 EEG system consisting
              of dry passive electrodes. All subjects (n = 27) participated in
              two recording sessions on separate days, one with the wet EEG
              system and one with the dry EEG system, in which the session
              order was counterbalanced across subjects. In each session, we
              recorded their EEG during separate rest periods with eyes open
              and closed followed by two versions of a serial visual
              presentation target detection task. Each task component allows
              for a neural measure reflecting different characteristics of the
              data, including spectral power in canonical low frequency bands,
              event-related potential components (specifically, the P3b), and
              single trial classification based on machine learning. The
              performance across the two systems was similar in most measures,
              including the P3b amplitude and topography, as well as low
              frequency (theta, alpha, and beta) spectral power at rest. Both
              EEG systems performed well above chance in the classification
              analysis, with a marginal advantage of the wet system over the
              dry. Critically, all aforementioned electrophysiological metrics
              showed significant positive correlations (r = 0.54-0.89) between
              the two EEG systems. This multitude of measures provides a
              comprehensive comparison that captures different aspects of EEG
              data, including temporal precision, frequency domain as well as
              multivariate patterns of activity. Taken together, our results

              activities of daily living (ADL) among patients with ischemic
              stroke. METHODS: Using the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure
              Combination inpatient database, we retrospectively analyzed
              consecutive patients with ischemic stroke at admission who
              received rehabilitation (n=100 719) from April 2012 to March
              2014. Early rehabilitation was defined as that starting within 3
              days after admission. The average rehabilitation intensity per
              day was calculated as the total units of rehabilitation during
              hospitalization divided by the length of hospital stay. A
              multivariable logistic regression analysis with multiple
              imputation and an instrumental variable analysis were performed
              to examine the association of early and intensive rehabilitation
              with the proportion of improved ADL score. RESULTS: The
              proportion of improved ADL score was higher in the early and
              intensive rehabilitation group. The multivariable logistic
              regression analysis showed that significant improvements in ADL
              were observed for early rehabilitation (odds ratio: 1.08; 95\%

              variable analysis showed that an increased proportion of improved
              ADL was associated with early rehabilitation (risk difference:
              2.8\%; 95\% confidence interval: 2.0-3.4\%; P<0.001) and

              during hospitalization in patients with ischemic stroke.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: While the precise timing and intensity of very early
              rehabilitation (VER) after stroke onset is still under
              discussion, its beneficial effect on functional disability is
              generally accepted. The recently published randomized controlled
              AVERT trial indicated that patients with severe stroke might be
              more susceptible to harmful side effects of VER, which we
              hypothesized is contrary to current clinical practice. We
              analyzed the Baden-Wuerttemberg stroke registry to gain insight
              into the application of VER in acute ischemic stroke (IS) and
              intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in clinical practice. METHODS:
              99,753 IS patients and 8824 patients with ICH hospitalized from
              January 2008 to December 2012 were analyzed. Data on the access
              to physical therapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT), and speech
              therapy (ST), the time from admission to first contact with a
              therapist and the average number of therapy sessions during the
              first 7 days of admission are reported. Multiple logistic
              regression models adjusted for patient and treatment
              characteristics were carried out to investigate the influence of
              VER on clinical outcome. RESULTS: PT was applied in 90/87\%
              (IS/ICH), OT in 63/57\%, and ST in 70/65\% of the study
              population. Therapy was mostly initiated within 24 h (PT 87/82\%)
              or 48 h after admission (OT 91/89\% and ST 93/90\%). Percentages
              of patients under therapy and also the average number of therapy
              sessions were highest in those with a discharge modified Rankin
              Scale score of 2 to 5 and lowest in patients with complete
              recovery or death during hospitalization. The outcome analyses
              were fundamentally hindered due to biases by individual decision
              making regarding the application and frequency of VER.
              CONCLUSIONS: While most patients had access to PT we noticed an
              undersupply of OT and ST. Only little differences were observed
              between patients with IS and ICH. The staff decisions for
              treatment seem to reflect attempts to optimize resources.
              Patients with either excellent or very unfavorable prognosis were
              less frequently assigned to VER and, if treated, received a lower
              average number of therapy sessions. On the contrary, severely
              disabled patients received VER at high frequency, although
              potentially harmful according to recent indications from the
              randomized controlled AVERT trial.",

              stroke, left brain injury, earlier IRH admission, and a longer
              IRH stay were associated with total functional improvement.

              muscles, smaller integrated EMG in the posterior muscles, and
              greater extent of integrated EMG attenuation over time. The UOA

              functional capacity of the gastrocnemius muscle than the SOA did.
              Those findings indicate that the SOA and UOA had limited ability

               degrees of freedom allows us to perform activities of daily
               living under various task constraints. Healthy old adults
               exhibit subclinical peripheral and central nervous system
               dysfunctions, possibly compromising the flexibility in
               inter-joint coordination during voluntary movements and the
               ability to adapt to varying task constraints. METHOD: We
               examined how healthy old (75.4 $\pm$ 5.2 years, n = 14) compared
               with young adults (24.3 $\pm$ 2 years, n = 15) make use of the
               available motor flexibility to adapt to physical and dexterity
               constraints during a rapid goal-directed reaching task. We
               manipulated physical and dexterity demands by changing,
               respectively, external resistance and target size. Motor
               flexibility was quantified by an uncontrolled manifold (UCM)
               analysis. RESULTS: We found that healthy young and old adults
               employ similar motor flexibility as quantified by the ratio
               between goal equivalent and non-goal equivalent variability (V
               Ratio) and were similarly able to adapt to increases in physical
               and dexterity demands during goal-directed rapid reaching (V
               Ratio: p = .092; young: 0.548 $\pm$ 0.113; old: 0.264 $\pm$
               0.117). Age affected end-effector kinematics. Motor flexibility
               and end-effector kinematics did not correlate. CONCLUSION: The
               data challenge the prevailing view that old age affects movement
               capabilities in general and provide specific evidence that
               healthy old adults preserve motor flexibility during a reaching
               task. Future studies applying UCM analysis should examine if
               experimental set-ups limit movement exploration, leaving

               whether the brain of young and older adults is activated

               purpose, soleus (SOL) and tibialis motor evoked potentials
               (MEPs) and SOL H-reflexes were elicited while 15 elderly (mean
               $\pm$ SD = 71 $\pm$ 4.6 years) and 15 young participants (mean
               $\pm$ SD = 27 $\pm$ 4.6 years) mentally simulated static and
               dynamic balance tasks using motor imagery (MI), action
               observation (AO) or the combination of AO and MI (AO + MI).
               Young subjects displayed significant modulations of MEPs that
               depended on the kind of mental simulation and the postural task.
               Elderly adults also revealed differences between tasks, but not
               between mental simulation conditions. Furthermore, the elderly
               displayed larger MEP facilitation during mental simulation

               to the young and a task-dependent modulation of the tibialis

               modulated H-reflexes and bEMG in the SOL muscle, despite large
               variations in the MEP-amplitudes, there seems to be an

  abstract  = "PURPOSE: We explored changes in muscle interactions during
               healthy aging as a window into neural control strategies of
               postural preparation to action/perturbation. In particular, we
               quantified the strength of multi-muscle synergies stabilizing
               the center of pressure (COP) displacement during the preparation
               for making a step associated with support surface translations.
               METHODS: Young and elderly subjects were required to make a step
               in response to support surface perturbations. Surface muscle
               activity of 11 leg and trunk muscles was analyzed to identify
               sets of 4 muscle modes (M-modes). Linear combinations of M-modes
               and their relationship to changes in the COP displacement in the
               anterior-posterior direction were then determined. Uncontrolled
               manifold analysis was performed to determine variance components
               in the M-mode space and indices of M-mode synergy stabilizing
               COP displacement. RESULTS: Prior to the step initiation, the
               older subjects showed strong synergies that stabilized COP
               displacement to forward perturbation of the support surface.
               However, the synergy indices were significantly lower than those
               of the young subjects during preparation for making a step. The
               timings of early postural adjustment (EPA) and anticipatory
               postural adjustment (APA) were consistently earlier in the young
               subjects as compared to the older subjects. For both groups, the
               timing of EPA did not change across tasks, while APA showed
               delayed timing in response to the support surface translations.
               CONCLUSIONS: We infer that changes in the indices of synergies
               with age may present challenges for the control of postural
               preparation to external perturbation in older adults. They may
               lead to excessive muscle co-contractions and low stability of
               COP displacement. The results reported here could have clinical
               relevance when identifying the risk of making a step, which has
               been linked to an increased risk of falls among the elderly.",

               goal-directed movements. Here we consider two problems that the

               first problem is that sensory feedback is noisy and delayed,
               which can make movements inaccurate and unstable. The second
               problem is that the relationship between a motor command and the
               movement it produces is variable, as the body and the
               environment can both change. A solution is to build adaptive
               internal models of the body and the world. The predictions of
               these internal models, called forward models because they
               transform motor commands into sensory consequences, can be used
               to both produce a lifetime of calibrated movements, and to
               improve the ability of the sensory system to estimate the state
               of the body and the world around it. Forward models are only
               useful if they produce unbiased predictions. Evidence shows that

              understanding of the potential cortical contributions to bipedal
              balance control. Temporally unpredictable postural perturbations
              evoke a negative potential (N1), which has drawn parallels to
              error-related negativity (ERN) as well as visual and auditory
              evoked N1 responses. The mechanism underlying the generation of
              event-related potentials (ERPs) has been a matter of debate for
              the past few decades. While the evoked model proposes that ERPs
              are generated by the addition of fixed latency and fixed polarity
              responses, the phase reorganization model suggests that ERPs are
              the result of stimulus-induced phase reorganization of the
              ongoing oscillations. Previous studies have suggested phase
              reorganization as a possible mechanism in auditory N1, visual N1
              and error-related negativity (ERN). The purpose of the current
              study was to explore the frequency characteristics of the
              cortical responses to whole-body balance perturbations.
              Perturbations were evoked using a lean and release protocol. The

              of delta, theta, alpha, and beta band activity during

               particular attention as a means of gauging the generalisation of
               acquired capability. Both theoretical treatments and prior

               a physical training regime is required to bring about
               generalised changes that extend to the untrained limb. In the
               present study, we pose the following question: Does interlimb
               transfer occur if and only if the training movements are
               executed? We report findings from JG-an individual recruited to
               a larger scale trial, who presented with (unilateral) deficits
               of motor control. We examined whether changes in the performance
               of the untrained right limb arose following practice undertaken
               by the impaired left limb, wherein the majority of JG's attempts

               days, 10 days and 1 year following training) indicated that
               effective learning had occurred. Learning was, however,
               expressed principally when the unimpaired (i.e. untrained) limb

               must coordinate the many degrees of freedom in the
               musculoskeletal apparatus. It has been suggested that the CNS
               simplifies this formidable task of coordination by grouping
               multiple muscles together into units of activation, or muscle
               synergies. Previous studies have shown that electromyogram (EMG)
               signals collected from many muscles during natural behaviors can
               be reconstructed by linearly combining a few synergies,
               identified by the non-negative matrix factorization algorithm.
               But to what extent synergies are neural constraints, or merely
               structures reflecting experimental constraints, has remained an
               open question. I address this question with the hypothesis that,
               muscle synergies are robust neural patterns constraining motor
               outputs. The strategy adopted was that of analyzing EMGs
               collected before and after delivery of a perturbation to the
               motor system. In my first experiment, EMGs from bullfrog muscles

               participants produced isometric flexion/extension and
               pronation/supination torques at the radiohumeral joint, either
               in isolation (e.g., flexion) or in combination (e.g.,
               flexion-supination), to acquire targets presented by a visual
               display. A cursor superimposed on the display provided feedback
               of the applied torques. During pre- and postpractice tests, the
               participants acquired targets in eight directions located either
               3.6 cm (20\% maximal voluntary contraction [MVC]) or 7.2 cm
               (40\% MVC) from a neutral cursor position. On each of five
               consecutive days of practice the participants acquired targets
               located 5.4 cm (30\% MVC) from the neutral position. EMG was
               recorded from eight muscles contributing to torque production
               about the radiohumeral joint during the pre- and posttests.
               Target-acquisition time decreased significantly with practice in
               most target directions and at both target torque levels. These
               performance improvements were primarily associated with
               increases in the peak rate of torque development after practice.
               At a muscular level, these changes were brought about by
               increases in the rates of recruitment of all agonist muscles.
               The spatiotemporal organization of muscle synergies was not
               significantly altered after practice. The observed adaptations
               appear to lead to performances that are generalizable to actions
               that require both greater and smaller joint torques than that
               practiced, and may be successfully recalled after a substantial
               period without practice. These results suggest that tasks in
               which performance is improved by increasing the rate of muscle
               activation, and thus the rate of joint torque development, may
               benefit in terms of the extent to which acquired levels of
               performance are maintained over time.",

              unlike the occipito-temporal sites where differences occurred at
              much higher frequencies (high beta/gamma). Our data indicate that
              N170 amplitude is sensitive to the amount of movement in the

              comparisons of the current data to previously reported studies.
              Broadband suppression of central beta activity, and significant

              while performing a flanker task. In contrast to the main
              hypotheses, the results revealed that the location of the N1 was
              not within the ACC. The mean Talairach coordinates for the ERN
              were (6.47, -4.41, 41.17) mm, corresponding to the cingulate
              gyrus [Brodmann area (BA) 24], as expected. However, coordinates
              for the N1 dipole were (5.74, -11.81, 53.73) mm, corresponding to
              the medial frontal gyrus (BA 6), specifically the supplementary
              motor area. This may suggest the N1 is linked to the planning and
              execution of elements of the evoked balance reactions rather than
              being associated with error or event detection. Alternatively, it
              is possible that the N1 is associated with variation in the
              cortical representation due to task-specific differences in the
              activation of a distributed network of error-related processing.
              Subsequent work should focus on disentangling these two possible
              explanations as they relate to the cortical processing linked to
              reactive balance control.",

              elicits an evoked potential, termed the perturbation-evoked
              potential (PEP). PEPs are widely distributed over
              fronto-centro-parietal areas with maximal amplitude at the FCz/Cz

              are comprised of a small positive potential (P1) that peaks
              around 30-90ms after perturbation onset, a large negative
              potential (N1) that peaks around 90-160ms, followed by positive
              (P2) and negative (N2) potentials between 200 and 400ms.

               a robot-assisted gait-training experiment. To enable functional
               neuroimaging during walking, we applied source modeling to
               high-density (120 channels) EEG recordings using individual
               anatomy reconstructed from structural magnetic resonance imaging
               scans. First, we analyzed amplitude differences between the
               conditions, walking and upright standing. Second, we
               investigated amplitude modulations related to the gait phase.
               During active walking upper $\mu$ (10-12 Hz) and $\beta$ (18-30
               Hz) oscillations were suppressed [event-related
               desynchronization (ERD)] compared to upright standing.
               Significant $\beta$ ERD activity was located focally in central
               sensorimotor areas for 9/10 subjects. Additionally, we found
               that low $\gamma$ (24-40 Hz) amplitudes were modulated related
               to the gait phase. Because there is a certain frequency band
               overlap between sustained $\beta$ ERD and gait phase related
               modulations in the low $\gamma$ range, these two phenomena are
               superimposed. Thus, we observe gait phase related amplitude
               modulations at a certain ERD level. We conclude that sustained
               $\mu$ and $\beta$ ERD reflect a movement related state change of
               cortical excitability while gait phase related modulations in
               the low $\gamma$ represent the motion sequence timing during
               gait. Interestingly, the center frequencies of sustained $\beta$
               ERD and gait phase modulated amplitudes were identified to be
               different. They may therefore be caused by different neuronal
               rhythms, which should be taken under consideration in future

              decreasing metabolic cost and preferred step width. To test these

              springs pulling bilaterally from the waist, to human subjects

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The experimental study of stumble recovery is
              essential to better understanding the reflexive mechanisms that
              help prevent falls as well as the deficiencies in fall-prone
              populations. This study would benefit from a system that can
              introduce perturbations that: 1) are realistic (e.g., obstacle
              disrupting the foot in swing phase), 2) are unanticipated by
              subjects, 3) are controllable in their timing, and 4) allow for
              kinematic and kinetic evaluation. METHODS: A stumble perturbation
              system was designed that consists of an obstacle delivery
              apparatus that releases an obstacle onto a force-instrumented
              treadmill and a predictive targeting algorithm which controls the
              timing of the perturbation to the foot during swing phase. Seven
              healthy subjects were recruited to take part in an experimental
              protocol for system validation, which consisted of two
              sub-experiments. First, a perception experiment determined
              whether subjects could perceive the obstacle as it slid onto the
              treadmill belt. Second, a perturbation experiment assessed the
              timing accuracy of perturbations relative to a target percent
              swing input by the experimenter. Data from this experiment were
              then used to demonstrate that joint kinematics and kinetics could
              be computed before and after the perturbation. RESULTS: Out of
              168 perception trials (24 per subject), not a single obstacle was
              perceived entering the treadmill by the subjects. Out of 196
              perturbation trials, 190 trials successfully induced a stumble
              event, with a mean targeting accuracy, relative to the desired
              percent swing, of 25 ms (6.2\% of swing phase). Joint kinematic
              and kinetic results were then computed for three common stumble
              recovery strategies and shown to be qualitatively consistent with
              results from prior stumble studies conducted overground.
              CONCLUSIONS: The stumble perturbation system successfully
              introduced realistic obstacle perturbations that were
              unanticipated by subjects. The targeting accuracy substantially
              reduced mistrials (i.e., trials that did not elicit a stumble)
              compared to previous studies. This accuracy enables stumble
              recovery to be studied more systematically as a function of when
              the perturbation occurs during swing phase. Lastly, joint
              kinematic and kinetic estimates allow for a comprehensive
              analysis of stumble recovery biomechanics.",

              concept of the information flow rate is founded in the theory of
              stochastic dynamical systems and its derivation is based on first
              principles; unlike various commonly used linear and nonlinear
              correlations and empirical directional coefficients, the
              information flow rate can measure causal relations between time
              series with minimal assumptions. We apply the information flow
              rate to electroencephalography (EEG) signals in adolescent males
              to map out the directed, causal, spatial interactions between
              brain regions during resting-state conditions. To our knowledge,
              this is the first study of effective connectivity in the
              adolescent brain. Our analysis reveals that adolescents show a
              pattern of information flow that is strongly left lateralized,
              and consists of short and medium ranged bidirectional
              interactions across the frontal-central-temporal regions. These
              results suggest an intermediate state of brain maturation in
              adolescence.",

  abstract = "Abstract A large and rapidly growing number of studies on autism
              spectrum disorder (ASD) have used resting-state fMRI to identify
              various alterations of functional connectivity (FC), with the
              hope of identifying clinically useful biomarkers or neural
              mechanisms underlying ASD. However, results have been largely
              inconsistent across studies, and there is therefore a pressing
              need to determine the primary factors influencing this lack of
              replicability. Here, we used resting-state (rs-fMRI) data from
              the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE-I and II) to
              investigate two factors thought to strongly influence
              replicability: the use of different denoising methods (i.e., data
              preprocessing) and data site (which differ in terms of sample,
              data acquisition parameters, etc.). Using four independently
              acquired datasets and 31 different denoising strategies, we
              examined the replicability of patterns of both group-averaged
              functional connectomes and group-level differences (i.e., ASD vs.
              control). Within datasets, both group-averages and
              group-comparisons of functional connectomes were highly
              consistent (r = 0.92 $\pm$0.06 / r = 0.80$\pm$0.09) across
              different pipelines, with the largest differences across
              pipelines reflecting whether global signal regression (GSR) was
              used. However, across datasets, while group-averages were still
              highly consistent (r = 0.86$\pm$0.02), group differences did not
              replicate, regardless of denoising strategy: indeed, consistency
              of group differences was so low (r = 0.09$\pm$0.05) that
              differences identified in one dataset had essentially no
              relationship with those in other datasets. Across-site similarity
              remained low even when considering the data at the network (as
              opposed to edge) level. Because there are a number of additional
              methodological factors that can influence the reliable detection
              of group differences (e.g., scanner-related differences, subject
              differences, post-processing analysis, effect sizes of ASD
              alterations, amount and quality of data), these results cannot
              completely rule out the existence of replicable resting-state FC
              differences in ASD. However, they do highlight the importance of
              examining replicability in future studies of ASD, and, more
              generally, call for extra caution when describing and
              interpreting alterations in functional connectivity across groups
              of individuals.",

              relies on a more distributed set of cortical regions than younger
              adults in order to maintain successful levels of performance
              during demanding cognitive tasks. However, it remains unclear how
              task demands give rise to this age-related expansion in cortical
              networks. To investigate this issue, we used functional magnetic
              resonance imaging to measure univariate activity, network
              connectivity, and cognitive performance in younger and older
              adults during a working memory (WM) task. In the WM task
              investigated, participants hold letters online (maintenance)
              while reordering them alphabetically (manipulation). WM load was
              titrated to obtain four individualized difficulty levels. Network
              integration---defined as the ratio of within-versus
              between-network connectivity---was linked to individual
              differences in WM capacity. The study yielded three main
              findings. First, as task difficulty increased, network
              integration decreased in younger adults, whereas it increased in
              older adults. Second, age-related increases in network
              integration were driven by increases in right hemispheric
              connectivity to both left and right cortical regions, a finding
              that helps to reconcile extant theories of compensatory
              recruitment in aging to address the multivariate dynamics of
              global network functioning. Lastly, older adults with higher WM
              capacity demonstrated higher levels of network integration in the
              most difficult condition. These results shed light on the
              mechanisms of age-related network reorganization by suggesting
              that changes in network connectivity may act as an adaptive form
              of compensation, with older adults recruiting a more distributed
              cortical network as task demands increase.Significance statement
              Older adults often activate brain regions not engaged by younger
              adults, but the circumstances under which this widespread network
              emerges are unclear. Here, we examined the effects of aging on
              network connectivity between task regions recruited during a
              working memory (WM) manipulation task, and the rest of the brain.
              We found an age-related increase in the more global network
              integration in older adults, and an association between this
              integration and working memory capacity in older adults. The
              findings are generally consistent with the compensatory
              interpretation of these effects.",

              which spatially and spectrally distributed information can be
              integrated in the brain. There is, however, a lack of methods
              decomposing brain electrophysiological data into interacting
              components. Here, we propose a novel framework for detecting such
              interactions in Magneto- and Electroencephalography (MEG/EEG),
              which we refer to as Nonlinear Interaction Decomposition (NID).
              In contrast to all previous methods for separation of
              cross-frequency (CF) sources in the brain, we propose that the
              extraction of nonlinearly interacting oscillations can be based
              on the statistical properties of their linear mixtures. The main
              idea of NID is that nonlinearly coupled brain oscillations can be
              mixed in such a way that the resulting linear mixture has a
              non-Gaussian distribution. We evaluate this argument analytically
              for amplitude-modulated narrow-band oscillations which are either
              phase-phase or amplitude-amplitude CF coupled. We validated NID
              extensively with simulated EEG obtained with realistic head
              modeling. The method extracted nonlinearly interacting components
              reliably even at SNRs as small as −15 (dB). Additionally, we
              applied NID to the resting-state EEG of 81 subjects to
              characterize CF phase-phase coupling between alpha and beta
              oscillations. The extracted sources were located in temporal,
              parietal and frontal areas, demonstrating the existence of
              diverse local and distant nonlinear interactions in resting-state
              EEG data.",

              coupling in the frequency domain from electro-physiological data

              approximation, though certainly not perfectly, Gaussian
              distributed. This work is based on the well-known fact that for
              Gaussian distributed data, the cross-spectrum completely
              determines all statistical properties. In particular, for an
              infinite number of data, all normalized coupling measures at a
              given frequency are a function of complex coherency. However, it
              is largely unknown what the functional relations are. We here
              present those functional relations for six different measures:
              the weighted phase lag index, the phase lag index, the absolute
              value and imaginary part of the phase locking value (PLV), power
              envelope correlation, and power envelope correlation with
              correction for artifacts of volume conduction. With the exception

              phase-phase coupling deviations from the model are in general
              minor, while power envelope correlations systematically deviate
              from the model for all frequencies. For power envelope
              correlation with correction for artifacts of volume conduction
              the model cannot explain the observed couplings at all. We also

              frequency in an event related experiment using a stroop reaction

              of inconsistencies can be attributed to procedural and conceptual

              Parkinson's Disease (PD) has shown comparable clinical
              improvements to continuous stimulation, yet with less stimulation
              times and side effects. In this form of control, stimulation is
              driven by pathological beta oscillations recorded from the
              subthalamic nucleus, which have been shown to correlate with PD
              motor symptoms. An important consideration is that beta activity
              is itself modulated during volitional movements, yet it is
              unknown the impact that these volitional modulations may have on
              the efficacy of closed-loop systems. Here, three PD patients
              performed a functional reaching task during closed-loop
              stimulation while we measured their motor behavior. Our results
              show that closed-loop stimulation can alter motor performance at
              distinct movement intervals. Of particular relevance, closed-loop
              DBS compromised behavior during the returning period by
              increasing the amount of submovements executed, and in turn
              delayed movement termination. Following these findings, we
              hypothesize that the use of machine learning decoding different
              movement intervals to fully switch off the stimulator may be
              beneficial, and present here an exemplary approach decoding the
              initiation of the movement returning interval above chance level.
              These findings highlight the importance of evaluating these

              learning to predict observations about the world. Specifically,

              being the result of intensive and extensive motor training

              10, 12, 14 and 16 s). Weighted clustering coefficient (CCw),
              weighted characteristic path length (L w) and minimum spanning
              tree (MST) parameters were computed to evaluate the network
              topology. The analysis was performed on both scalp and
              source-space data. MAIN RESULTS: Results from scalp analysis show
              a decrease in both mean PLI and AEC values with an increase in
              epoch length, with a tendency to stabilize at a length of 12 s
              for PLI and 6 s for AEC. Moreover, CCw and L w show very similar
              behaviour, with metrics based on AEC more reliable in terms of
              stability. In general, MST parameters stabilize at short epoch
              lengths, particularly for MSTs based on PLI (1-6 s versus 4-8 s
              for AEC). At the source-level the results were even more
              reliable, with stability already at 1 s duration for PLI-based
              MSTs. SIGNIFICANCE: The present work suggests that both PLI and
              AEC depend on epoch length and that this has an impact on the
              reconstructed network topology, particularly at the scalp-level.
              Source-level MST topology is less sensitive to differences in
              epoch length, therefore enabling the comparison of brain network
              topology between different studies.",

              conclusions drawn regarding the topology of the underlying
              networks should, ideally, not depend on the approach. The aim of
              the present work was to find an answer to the following
              questions: does scalp analysis provide a correct estimate of the
              network topology? how big are the distortions when using various
              pipelines in different experimental conditions? EEG recordings
              were analysed with amplitude- and phase-based metrics, founding a
              strong correlation for the global connectivity between scalp- and
              source-level. In contrast, network topology was only weakly
              correlated. The strongest correlations were obtained for MST leaf
              fraction, but only for FC metrics that limit the effects of
              volume conduction/signal leakage. These findings suggest that
              these effects alter the estimated EEG network organization,
              limiting the interpretation of results of scalp analysis.

  author   = "Allen, Jessica L and Kesar, Trisha M and Ting, Lena H",
  abstract = "Muscle coordination is often impaired after stroke, leading to
              deficits in the control of walking and balance. In this study, we
              examined features of muscle coordination associated with reduced
              walking performance in chronic stroke survivors using motor
              module (a.k.a. muscle synergy) analysis. We identified
              differences between stroke survivors and age-similar neurotypical
              controls in the modular control of both overground walking and
              standing reactive balance. In contrast to previous studies that
              demonstrated reduced motor module number poststroke, our cohort
              of stroke survivors did not exhibit a reduction in motor module
              number compared with controls during either walking or reactive
              balance. Instead, the pool of motor modules common to walking and
              reactive balance was smaller, suggesting reduced generalizability
              of motor module function across behaviors. The motor modules
              common to walking and reactive balance tended to be less variable
              and more distinct, suggesting more reliable output compared with
              motor modules specific to either behavior. Greater motor module
              generalization in stroke survivors was associated with faster
              walking speed, more normal step length asymmetry, and narrower
              step widths. Our work is the first to show that motor module
              generalization across walking and balance may help to distinguish
              important and clinically relevant differences in walking
              performance across stroke survivors that would have been
              overlooked by examining only a single behavior. Finally, because
              similar relationships between motor module generalization and
              walking performance have been demonstrated in healthy young
              adults and individuals with Parkinson's disease, this suggests
              that motor module generalization across walking and balance may
              be important for well-coordinated walking. NEW \& NOTEWORTHY This
              is the first work to simultaneously examine neuromuscular control
              of walking and standing reactive balance in stroke survivors. We
              show that motor module generalization across these behaviors
              (i.e., recruiting common motor modules) is reduced compared with
              controls and is associated with slower walking speeds, asymmetric
              step lengths, and larger step widths. This is true despite no
              between-group differences in module number, suggesting that motor
              module generalization across walking and balance is important for
              well-coordinated walking.",

  author   = "Maresch, Jana and Donchin, Opher",
  abstract = "Visuomotor rotations are frequently used to study cognitive
              processes underlying motor adaptation. Explicit aiming strategies
              and implicit recalibration are two of these processes. A large
              body of literature indicates that these two processes are
              dissociable and perhaps even independent components. Various
              direct and indirect methods have been used to dissociate the two
              processes. Discrepancies have been found between these different
              methods. They may arise for different reasons, but one reason may
              be that the different measures reflect different components of
              explicit and implicit knowledge. They may also be because of
              effects of the measurements themselves on the amount of explicit
              and implicit learning. The goal of this study was to directly
              compare verbal reporting, a direct measure of explicit knowledge,
              with indirect measures. We thus compared three different measures
              in two different conditions: during consistent reporting and
              during intermittent reporting. Our results show that our two
              conditions lead to a dissociation between the measures. In the
              consistent reporting group, all measures showed similar results.
              However, in the intermittent reporting condition, verbal
              reporting showed less explicit and more implicit knowledge than
              our two indirect methods. Verbal reporting seems to be
              insensitive to the changes in explicit knowledge caused by
              reporting. These findings suggest that verbal reporting reflects
              different components of explicit knowledge than those reflected
              in our indirect measures. A more sophisticated approach,
              including multiple components of explicit knowledge, may be
              necessary in order to fully understand motor adaptation. New and
              noteworthy We show that different measures of explicit knowledge
              can produce different results. As expected, reporting of intended
              aiming directions increases explicit knowledge; however, this
              cannot be seen in the reporting itself. Rather the increased
              explicit knowledge is revealed using an indirect measure of
              explicit knowledge called exclusion. This finding suggests that
              reporting reflects different components of explicit knowledge
              than those reflected in our indirect measure.",

  abstract = "KEY POINTS: Locomotion on land and in water requires the
              coordination of a great number of muscle activations and joint
              movements. Constant feedback about the position of own body parts
              in relation to the surrounding environment and the body itself
              (proprioception) is required to maintain stability and avoid
              failure. The central nervous system may follow a modular type of
              organization by controlling muscles in orchestrated groups
              (muscle synergies) rather than individually. We used this concept
              on genetically modified mice lacking muscle spindles, one of the
              two main classes of proprioceptors. We provide evidence that
              proprioceptive feedback is required by the central nervous system
              to accurately tune the modular organization of locomotion.
              ABSTRACT: For exploiting terrestrial and aquatic locomotion,
              vertebrates must build their locomotor patterns based on an
              enormous amount of variables. The great number of muscles and
              joints, together with the constant need for sensory feedback
              information (e.g. proprioception), make the task of controlling
              movement a problem with overabundant degrees of freedom. It is
              widely accepted that the central nervous system may simplify the
              creation and control of movement by generating activation
              patterns common to muscle groups, rather than specific to
              individual muscles. These activation patterns, called muscle
              synergies, describe the modular organization of movement. We
              extracted synergies through electromyography from the hind limb
              muscle activities of wild-type and genetically modified mice
              lacking sensory feedback from muscle spindles. Muscle
              spindle-deficient mice underwent a modification of the temporal
              structure (motor primitives) of muscle synergies that resulted in
              diminished functionality during walking. In addition, both the
              temporal and spatial (motor modules) components of synergies were
              severely affected when external perturbations were introduced or
              when animals were immersed in water. These findings show that
              sensory feedback from group Ia/II muscle spindles regulates motor
              function in normal and perturbed walking. Moreover, when group Ib
              Golgi tendon organ feedback is lacking due to enhanced buoyancy,
              the modular organization of swimming is almost completely
              compromised.",

              amplitude envelope correlation (co-modulation) and imaginary

  abstract = "Abstract Traditional views of sensorimotor adaptation, or

              the role of automatic, implicit correction of sensory prediction
              errors (differences between predicted and actual sensory
              outcomes). However, latent memories formed from sensorimotor
              adaptation, prominently evidenced in improved learning (i.e.,
              savings), have recently been attributed to strategic corrections
              of task errors (failures to achieve task goals). To dissociate
              contributions of task errors and sensory prediction errors to
              latent sensorimotor memories, we perturbed target locations to
              remove or enforce task errors during learning and/or test. We

              Stimulus- and response-triggered averages were computed from the
              midline EEG leads. In error trials, the ERP amplitude was reduced
              in the P300 range (300-500 msec) and enhanced in the slow wave
              range (500-700 msec) compared to correct reaction trials.
              Difference plots between the ERPs (incorrect minus correct
              reaction trials) revealed a large fronto-central negativity
              (``NE'') and a parieto-occipital ``slow wave.'' These components
              appeared larger in the response-triggered averages. We believe
              that they reflect two different stages of error processing. After
              auditory stimuli the NE peaked much later for DA than for FA,
              which supports the idea of an asymmetrical allocation of
              processing resources to the disadvantage of the auditory modality
              in our DA condition.",

  author    = "Izawa, Jun and Shadmehr, Reza",
  abstract  = "Voluntary motor commands produce two kinds of consequences.
               Initially, a sensory consequence is observed in terms of
               activity in our primary sensory organs (e.g., vision,
               proprioception). Subsequently, the brain evaluates the sensory
               feedback and produces a subjective measure of utility or
               usefulness of the motor commands (e.g., reward). As a result,
               comparisons between predicted and observed consequences of motor
               commands produce two forms of prediction error. How do these
               errors contribute to changes in motor commands? Here, we
               considered a reach adaptation protocol and found that when high
               quality sensory feedback was available, adaptation of motor
               commands was driven almost exclusively by sensory prediction
               errors. This form of learning had a distinct signature: as motor
               commands adapted, the subjects altered their predictions
               regarding sensory consequences of motor commands, and
               generalized this learning broadly to neighboring motor commands.
               In contrast, as the quality of the sensory feedback degraded,
               adaptation of motor commands became more dependent on reward
               prediction errors. Reward prediction errors produced comparable
               changes in the motor commands, but produced no change in the
               predicted sensory consequences of motor commands, and
               generalized only locally. Because we found that there was a
               within subject correlation between generalization patterns and
               sensory remapping, it is plausible that during adaptation an
               individual's relative reliance on sensory vs. reward prediction
               errors could be inferred. We suggest that while motor commands
               change because of sensory and reward prediction errors, only
               sensory prediction errors produce a change in the neural system
               that predicts sensory consequences of motor commands.",

  abstract  = "At least two distinct processes have been identified by which
               motor commands are adapted according to movement-related
               feedback: reward-based learning and sensory error-based
               learning. In sensory error-based learning, mappings between
               sensory targets and motor commands are recalibrated according to
               sensory error feedback. In reward-based learning, motor commands
               are associated with subjective value, such that successful
               actions are reinforced. We designed two tasks to isolate reward-
               and sensory error-based motor adaptation, and we used
               electroencephalography in humans to identify and dissociate the
               neural correlates of reward and sensory error feedback
               processing. We designed a visuomotor rotation task to isolate
               sensory error-based learning that was induced by altered visual
               feedback of hand position. In a reward learning task, we
               isolated reward-based learning induced by binary reward feedback
               that was decoupled from the visual target. A fronto-central
               event-related potential called the feedback-related negativity
               (FRN) was elicited specifically by binary reward feedback but
               not sensory error feedback. A more posterior component called
               the P300 was evoked by feedback in both tasks. In the visuomotor
               rotation task, P300 amplitude was increased by sensory error
               induced by perturbed visual feedback and was correlated with
               learning rate. In the reward learning task, P300 amplitude was
               increased by reward relative to nonreward and by surprise
               regardless of feedback valence. We propose that during motor
               adaptation the FRN specifically reflects a reward-based learning
               signal whereas the P300 reflects feedback processing that is
               related to adaptation more generally. NEW \& NOTEWORTHY We
               studied the event-related potentials evoked by feedback stimuli
               during motor adaptation tasks that isolate reward- and sensory
               error-based learning mechanisms. We found that the
               feedback-related negativity was specifically elicited by binary
               reward feedback, whereas the P300 was observed in both tasks.
               These results reveal neural processes associated with different
               learning mechanisms and elucidate which classes of errors, from
               a computational standpoint, elicit the feedback-related

  abstract  = "Perturbations of sensory feedback evoke sensory prediction

               outcomes of movements), and reward prediction errors

               When our task is to hit a target, we expect to succeed in
               hitting the target, and so we experience a reward prediction
               error if the perturbation causes us to miss it. These
               discrepancies between intended task outcomes and actual task
               outcomes, termed ``task errors,'' are thought to drive the use
               of strategic processes to restore success, although their role
               is incompletely understood. Here, as participants adapted to a
               30° rotation of cursor feedback representing hand position, we
               investigated the role of task errors in sensorimotor adaptation:
               during target-reaching, we either removed task errors by moving
               the target mid-movement to align with cursor feedback of hand
               position, or enforced task error by moving the target away from
               the cursor feedback of hand position, by 20-30° randomly
               (clockwise in half the trials, counterclockwise in half the
               trials). Removing task errors not only reduced the extent of
               adaptation during exposure to the perturbation, but also reduced
               the amount of post-adaptation aftereffects that persisted
               despite explicit knowledge of the perturbation removal. Hence,
               task errors contribute to implicit adaptation resulting from
               sensory prediction errors. This suggests that the system which
               predicts the sensory consequences of actions via exposure to
               sensory prediction errors is also sensitive to reward prediction
               errors.",

               whether or not aging impairs sensorimotor adaptation to a novel

               impairments in neural plasticity, or impairments in the specific
               processes that drive adaptation is unclear. Here we investigated
               whether there are age-related differences in
               electrophysiological responses to reaching endpoint and
               trajectory errors caused by a novel force field, and whether
               markers of error processing relate to the ability of older
               adults to adapt their movements. Older and young adults (N =
               24/group, both sexes) performed 600 reaches to visual targets,
               and received audio-visual feedback about task success or failure

               feedback [feedback error-related negativity (fERN)]. At a group
               level, older adults did not differ from young adults in the rate
               or extent of sensorimotor adaptation, but EEG responses to both
               trajectory errors and task errors were reduced in the older
               group. Most interestingly, the amplitude of the kERN correlated
               with the rate and extent of sensorimotor adaptation in older
               adults. Thus, older adults with an impaired capacity for
               encoding kinematic trajectory errors also have compromised

               physical activity among older persons, reliable and valid
               measures of physical activity are required that can also detect
               the expected types of physical activity changes in this
               population. This paper describes a self-report physical activity
               questionnaire for older men and women, developed to evaluate the
               outcomes of the Community Healthy Activities Model Program for
               Seniors (CHAMPS), an intervention to increase physical activity.
               METHODS: The questionnaire assesses weekly frequency and
               duration of various physical activities typically undertaken by
               older adults. We estimated caloric expenditure/wk expended in
               physical activity and created a summary frequency/wk measure. We
               calculated measures of each of these for: 1) activities of at
               least moderate intensity (MET value >/= 3.0); and 2) all
               specified physical activities, including those of light
               intensity. Six-month stability was estimated on participants not
               likely to change (assessment-only control group, physically
               active cohort). Several tests of construct validity were
               conducted, and sensitivity to change was analyzed based on
               response to the CHAMPS intervention. RESULTS: The sample (N =
               249) comprised underactive persons (N = 173 from the CHAMPS
               trial) and active persons (N = 76). The sample was aged 65-90 yr
               (mean = 74, SD = 6); 64\% were women, and 9\% were minorities.
               Six-month stability ranged from 0.58 to 0.67, using intraclass
               correlation coefficients. Nearly all construct validity
               hypotheses were confirmed, though correlations were modest. All
               measures were sensitive to change (P < or = 0.01), with small to
               moderate effect sizes (0.38-0.64). CONCLUSIONS: The CHAMPS
               measure may be useful for evaluating the effectiveness of
               programs aimed at increasing levels of physical activity in
               older adults.",

              concern for older adults; early identification of people at high
              risk for falling facilitates the provision of rehabilitation
              treatment to reduce future fall risk. The objective of this
              prospective cohort study was to examine the predictive validity
              of the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) for 3 types of outcomes-any fall
              (> or =1 fall), multiple falls (> or =2 falls), and injurious
              falls-by use of sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating
              characteristic (ROC) curves, area under the curve, and likelihood
              ratios. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A sample of 210 community-dwelling
              older adults received a comprehensive geriatric assessment at
              baseline, which included the BBS to measure balance. Data on
              prospective falls were collected monthly for a year. The
              predictive validity of the BBS for the identification of future
              fall risk was evaluated. RESULTS: The BBS had good discriminative
              ability to predict multiple falls when ROC analysis was used.
              However, the use of the BBS as a dichotomous scale, with a
              threshold of < or =45, was inadequate for the identification of
              the majority of people at risk for falling in the future, with
              sensitivities of 25\% and 45\% for any fall and for multiple
              falls, respectively. The use of likelihood ratios, maintaining
              the BBS as a multilevel scale, demonstrated a gradient of risk
              across scores, with fall risk increasing as scores decreased.
              DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The use of the BBS as a dichotomous
              scale to identify people at high risk for falling should be
              discouraged because it fails to identify the majority of such
              people. The predictive validity of this scale for multiple falls
              is superior to that for other types of falls, and the use of
              likelihood ratios preserves the gradient of risk across the whole
              range of scores.",

  abstract = "During sensorimotor tasks, subjects use sensory feedback but also
              prior information. It is often assumed that the sensorimotor
              prior is just given by the experiment and that the details for
              acquiring this prior (e.g., the effector) are irrelevant.
              However, recent research has suggested that the construction of
              priors is nontrivial. To test if the sensorimotor details matter
              for the construction of a prior, we designed two tasks that
              differ only in the effectors that subjects use to indicate their
              estimate. For both a typical reaching setting and an atypical
              wrist rotation setting, prior and feedback uncertainty matter as
              quantitatively predicted by Bayesian statistics. However, in
              violation of simple Bayesian models, the importance of the prior
              differs across effectors. Subjects overly rely on their prior in
              the typical reaching case compared with the wrist case. The brain
              is not naively Bayesian with a single and veridical prior. NEW \&
              NOTEWORTHY Traditional Bayesian models often assume that we learn
              statistics of movements and use the information as a prior to
              guide subsequent movements. The effector is merely a reporting
              modality for information processing. We asked subjects to perform
              a visuomotor learning task with different effectors (finger or
              wrist). Surprisingly, we found that prior information is used
              differently between the effectors, suggesting that learning of
              the prior is related to the movement context such as the effector
              involved or that naive models of Bayesian behavior need to be
              extended.",

              By its nature, such data is large and complex, making automated

              the very early stages of an EEG preprocessing pipeline can reduce
              the signal-to-noise ratio and introduce unwanted artifacts into
              the data, particularly for computations done in single precision.
              We demonstrate that ordinary average referencing improves the
              signal-to-noise ratio, but that noisy channels can contaminate
              the results. We also show that identification of noisy channels
              depends on the reference and examine the complex interaction of
              filtering, noisy channel identification, and referencing. We

              evidence is needed for cadence-based metrics supporting benchmark

              associated with desired outcomes) values that are informed by a
              systematic process. OBJECTIVE: To review how fast, in terms of
              cadence, is enough, with reference to crafting public health
              recommendations in adults. METHODS: A comprehensive search
              strategy was conducted to identify relevant studies focused on
              walking cadence and intensity for adults. Identified studies
              (n=38) included controlled (n=11), free-living observational
              (n=18) and intervention (n=9) designs. RESULTS: There was a
              strong relationship between cadence (as measured by direct
              observation and objective assessments) and intensity (indirect
              calorimetry). Despite acknowledged interindividual variability,
              $\geq$100 steps/min is a consistent heuristic (e.g,
              evidence-based, rounded) value associated with absolutely defined
              moderate intensity (3 metabolic equivalents (METs)).
              Epidemiological studies report notably low mean daily cadences
              (ie, 7.7 steps/min), shaped primarily by the very large
              proportion of time (13.5 hours/day) spent between zero and
              purposeful cadences (100 and >70 steps/min, respectively. Peak
              cadence indicators are negatively associated with increased age
              and body mass index. Identified intervention studies used cadence
              to either prescribe and/or quantify ambulatory intensity but the
              evidence is best described as preliminary. CONCLUSIONS: A cadence
              value of $\geq$100 steps/min in adults appears to be a consistent
              and reasonable heuristic answer to 'How fast is fast enough?'

               response was induced, and about equal when the tibialis anterior
               muscle was activated. The onset latencies were shorter on the
               displaced side (displaced leg 75-96 ms, non-displaced leg 93-112
               ms). 3. Bilateral perturbations in one direction were followed
               by larger EMG responses in both legs (in the gastrocnemius for
               backward-directed impulses, in the tibialis anterior for
               forward-directed impulses). For a given acceleration rate, their
               amplitude was about equal to the sum of the EMG amplitude of the
               displaced leg and that of the nondisplaced leg obtained during
               unilateral displacement. The inverse result was obtained when
               the legs were simultaneously displaced in opposite directions:
               EMG responses in both legs were significantly smaller than those
               obtained after unilateral displacement. 4. It is concluded that
               a unilateral displacement evokes reflex EMG responses in the
               synergistic muscles of both legs, which are graded according to
               the size of the proprioceptive input from the primarily
               displaced joint. During bilateral displacements, the activity
               induced by the respective contralateral leg is linearly summed
               or subtracted, depending on whether the legs are displaced in
               the same or in opposite directions. In view of the short
               latencies of these bilateral responses, it would seem that they
               are mediated by a spinal mechanism. 5. Distinct differences in
               the behavior of the antagonistic leg muscles were observed: 1)
               the coactivation of the contralateral leg muscle was
               significantly smaller when the gastrocnemius was stretched
               unilaterally, whereas it was about equal for the tibialis
               anterior; and 2) the gastrocnemius EMG responses were closely
               correlated with the displacement velocity, whereas the tibialis
               anterior response was more closely correlated with acceleration,
               i.e., the tibialis anterior response was more dynamic in
               nature.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

               cord injury has revealed that locomotor activity in one limb can
               activate rhythmic locomotor activity in the opposite limb.
               Although our previous research has demonstrated profound
               influences of the nonparetic limb on paretic limb motor activity
               poststroke, the potency of interlimb pathways for increasing
               recruitment of the paretic limb motor pattern is unknown. This
               experiment tested whether there is an increased propensity for
               rhythmic motor activity in one limb (pedaling limb) to induce
               rhythmic motor activity in the opposite limb (test limb) in
               persons poststroke. Forty-nine subjects with chronic poststroke
               hemiparesis and twenty controls pedaled against a constant
               mechanical load with their pedaling leg while we recorded EMG
               and pedal forces from the test leg. For the experimental
               conditions, subjects were instructed to either pedal with their
               test leg (bilateral pedaling) or rest their test leg while it
               was either stationary or moved anti-phased (unilateral
               pedaling). In persons poststroke, unilateral pedaling activated
               a complete pattern of rhythmic alternating muscle activity in
               the nonpedaling, test leg. This effect was most clearly
               demonstrated in the most severely impaired individuals. In most
               of the control subjects, unilateral pedaling activated some
               muscles in the nonpedaling leg weakly, if at all. We propose
               that, ipsilateral excitatory pathways associated with
               contralateral pedaling in control subjects are increasingly
               up-regulated in both legs in persons with hemiparesis as a
               function of increased hemiparetic severity. This enhancement of
               interlimb pathways may be of functional importance since
               contralateral pedaling induced a complete motor pattern of
               similar amplitude to the bilateral pattern in both the paretic
               and nonparetic leg of the subjects with severe hemiparesis.",

  abstract  = "Neuroimaging studies have provided evidence for the involvement
               of frontal and parietal cortices in postural control. However,
               the specific role of these brain areas for postural control
               remains to be known. Here, we investigated the effects of
               disruptive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over
               supplementary motor areas (SMA) during challenging continuous
               balance task in healthy young adults. We hypothesized that a
               virtual lesion of SMA will alter activation within the brain
               network identified using electroencephalography (EEG) and impair
               performance of the postural task. Twenty healthy young adults
               received either continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) or
               sham stimulation over SMA followed by the performance of a
               continuous balance task with or without somatosensory input
               distortion created by sway-referencing the support surface. cTBS
               over SMA compared to sham stimulation showed a smaller increase
               in root mean square of center of pressure as the difficulty of
               continuous balance task increased suggestive of altered postural
               control mechanisms to find a stable solution under challenging
               sensory conditions. Consistent with earlier studies, we found
               sources of EEG activation within anterior cingulate (AC),
               cingulate gyrus (CG), bilateral posterior parietal regions (PPC)

               sham stimulation altered EEG power within the identified
               fronto-parietal regions. These findings suggest that the changes
               in activation within distant fronto-parietal brain areas
               following cTBS over SMA contributed to the altered postural
               behavior. Our study confirms a critical role of AC, CG, and both

  abstract = "We hypothesized that expert epileptologists can detect seizures
              directly by visually analyzing EEG plot images, unlike automated
              methods that analyze spectro-temporal features or complex,
              non-stationary features of EEG signals. If so, seizure detection
              could benefit from convolutional neural networks because their
              visual recognition ability is comparable to that of humans. We
              explored image-based seizure detection by applying convolutional
              neural networks to long-term EEG that included epileptic
              seizures. After filtering, EEG data were divided into short
              segments based on a given time window and converted into plot EEG
              images, each of which was classified by convolutional neural
              networks as 'seizure' or 'non-seizure'. These resultant labels
              were then used to design a clinically practical index for seizure
              detection. The best true positive rate was obtained using a 1-s
              time window. The median true positive rate of convolutional
              neural networks labelling by seconds was 74\%, which was higher
              than that of commercially available seizure detection software
              (20\% by BESA and 31\% by Persyst). For practical use, the median
              of detected seizure rate by minutes was 100\% by convolutional
              neural networks, which was higher than the 73.3\% by BESA and
              81.7\% by Persyst. The false alarm of convolutional neural
              networks' seizure detection was issued at 0.2 per hour, which
              appears acceptable for clinical practice. Moreover, we
              demonstrated that seizure detection improved when training was
              performed using EEG patterns similar to those of testing data,
              suggesting that adding a variety of seizure patterns to the
              training dataset will improve our method. Thus, artificial visual
              recognition by convolutional neural networks allows for seizure
              detection, which otherwise currently relies on skillful visual
              inspection by expert epileptologists during clinical diagnosis.",

              no direct lesion of the brainstem and cerebellar structures
              involved in motor automatic processes. Post-stroke, improvements
              of motor activities including standing and locomotion are
              variable but are typically characterized by a common postural
              behaviour which involves the unaffected side more for body
              support and balance control, likely in response to initial muscle
              weakness of the affected side. Various rehabilitation strategies
              are regularly used or in development, targeting muscle activity,
              postural and gait tasks, using more or less high-technology
              equipment. Reduced walking speed often improves with time and
              with various rehabilitation strategies, but asymmetric postural
              behaviour during standing and walking is often reinforced,
              maintained, or only transitorily decreased. This asymmetric
              compensatory postural behaviour appears to be robust, driven by
              support and balance tasks maintaining the predominant use of the
              unaffected side over the initially impaired affected side. Based
              on these elements, stroke rehabilitation including affected
              muscle strengthening and often stretching would first need to
              correct the postural asymmetric pattern by exploiting postural
              automatic processes in various particular motor tasks secondarily
              beneficial to gait.",

  author   = "Sharif Razavian, Reza and Ghannadi, Borna and McPhee, John",
  abstract = "It has been suggested that the human nervous system controls
              motions in the task (or operational) space. However, little
              attention has been given to the separation of the control of the
              task-related and task-irrelevant degrees of freedom. Aim: We
              investigate how muscle synergies may be used to separately
              control the task-related and redundant degrees of freedom in a
              computational model. Approach: We generalize an existing motor
              control model, and assume that the task and redundant spaces have
              orthogonal basis vectors. This assumption originates from
              observations that the human nervous system tightly controls the
              task-related variables, and leaves the rest uncontrolled. In
              other words, controlling the variables in one space does not
              affect the other space; thus, the actuations must be orthogonal
              in the two spaces. We implemented this assumption in the model by
              selecting muscle synergies that produce force vectors with
              orthogonal directions in the task and redundant spaces. Findings:
              Our experimental results show that the orthogonality assumption
              performs well in reconstructing the muscle activities from the
              measured kinematics/dynamics in the task and redundant spaces.
              Specifically, we found that approximately 70\% of the variation
              in the measured muscle activity can be captured with the
              orthogonality assumption, while allowing efficient separation of
              the control in the two spaces. Implications: The developed motor
              control model is a viable tool in real-time simulations of
              musculoskeletal systems, as well as model-based control of
              bio-mechatronic systems, where a computationally efficient
              representation of the human motion controller is needed.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to determine if walking speed affected
              human sensorimotor electrocortical dynamics using mobile
              high-density electroencephalography (EEG). METHODS: To overcome
              limitations associated with motion and muscle artifact
              contamination in EEG recordings, we compared solutions for
              artifact removal using novel dual layer EEG electrodes and
              alternative signal processing methods. Dual layer EEG
              simultaneously recorded human electrocortical signals and
              isolated motion artifacts using pairs of mechanically coupled and
              electrically independent electrodes. For electrical muscle
              activity removal, we incorporated electromyographic (EMG)
              recordings from the neck into our mobile EEG data processing
              pipeline. We compared artifact removal methods during treadmill
              walking at four speeds (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 m/s). RESULTS:
              Left and right sensorimotor alpha and beta spectral power
              increased in contralateral limb single support and push off, and
              decreased during contralateral limb swing at each speed. At
              faster walking speeds, sensorimotor spectral power fluctuations
              were less pronounced across the gait cycle with reduced alpha and
              beta power (p<0.05) compared to slower speeds. Isolated noise
              recordings and neck EMG spectral power fluctuations matched gait
              events and showed broadband spectral power increases at faster
              speeds. CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE: Dual layer EEG enabled us to
              isolate changes in human sensorimotor electrocortical dynamics
              across walking speeds. A comparison of signal processing
              approaches revealed similar intrastride cortical fluctuations
              when applying common (e.g. Artifact Subspace Reconstruction) and
              novel artifact rejection methods. Dual layer EEG, however,
              allowed us to document and rule out residual artifacts, which
              exposed sensorimotor spectral power changes across gait speeds.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Prior work indicates that pedaling-related brain
               activation is lower in people with stroke than in controls. We
               asked whether this observation could be explained by
               between-group differences in volitional motor commands and
               pedaling performance. METHODS: Individuals with and without
               stroke performed passive and volitional pedaling while brain
               activation was recorded with functional magnetic resonance
               imaging. The passive condition eliminated motor commands to
               pedal and minimized between-group differences in pedaling
               performance. Volume, intensity, and laterality of brain
               activation were compared across conditions and groups. RESULTS:
               There were no significant effects of condition and no Group
               $\times$ Condition interactions for any measure of brain
               activation. Only 53\% of subjects could minimize muscle activity
               for passive pedaling. CONCLUSIONS: Altered motor commands and
               pedaling performance are unlikely to account for reduced
               pedaling-related brain activation poststroke. Instead, this
               phenomenon may be due to functional or structural brain changes.
               Passive pedaling can be difficult to achieve and may require
               inhibition.",

               functions, is critical for performing various daily-life
               activities. Despite its essential function, assessment of brain
               activity during lower-limb movement is still limited because of
               the constraints of existing brain imaging methods. NEW METHOD:
               Here, we describe an MR-compatible, cylindrical treadmill device
               that allows participants to perform stepping movements on an MRI
               scanner table. The device was constructed from wood and all of
               the parts were handmade by the authors. RESULTS: We confirmed
               the MR-compatibility of the device by evaluating the temporal
               signal-to-noise ratio of 64 voxels of a phantom during scanning.
               Brain activity was measured while twenty participants turned the
               treadmill with feet in sync with metronome sounds. The rotary
               speed of the cylinder was encoded by optical fibers. The
               post/pre-central gyrus and cerebellum showed significant
               activity during the movements, which was comparable to the
               activity patterns reported in previous studies. Head movement on
               the y- and z-axes was influenced more by lower-limb movement
               than was head movement on the x-axis. Among the 60 runs (3 runs
               $\times$ 20 participants), head movement during two of the runs
               (3.3\%) was excessive due to the lower-limb movement. COMPARISON
               WITH EXISTING METHODS: Compared to MR-compatible devices
               proposed in the previous studies, the advantage of this device
               may be simple structure and replicability to realize stepping
               movement with a supine position. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our
               results suggest that the treadmill device is useful for
               evaluating lower-limb-related neural activity.",

              However, technical challenges have made it difficult to image the
              brain during multijoint lower limb movements like those involved
              in locomotion. We developed an MR compatible pedaling device and
              recorded human brain activity associated with rhythmic,
              alternating flexion and extension of the lower extremities. Ten
              volunteers pedaled at 30 RPM while recording fMRI signals in a GE
              3T short bore MR scanner. We utilized a block design consisting
              of 3 runs of pedaling, each lasting 4 min. In a single run,
              subjects pedaled for 30 s and then rested for 30 s. This sequence
              was repeated 4 times. Conventional fMRI processing techniques,
              that correlate the entire BOLD signal with standard model, did
              not extract physiologically meaningful signal, likely due to
              magnetic field distortion caused by leg movement. Hence, we
              examined only the portion of the blood-oxygen-level dependent
              (BOLD) signal during movement-free periods. This technique takes
              advantage of the delayed nature of the BOLD signal and fits the
              falling portion of the signal after movement has stopped with a
              standard model. Using this approach, we observed physiologically
              plausible brain activity patterns associated with pedaling in the
              primary and secondary sensory and motor cortices and the
              cerebellum. To our knowledge, this is the first time that human
              brain activity associated with pedaling has been recorded with
              fMRI. This technique may be useful for advancing our

  author   = "Park, Sungwoo and Finley, James M",
  abstract = "A fundamental feature of human locomotor control is the need to
              adapt our walking pattern in response to changes in the
              environment. For example, when people walk on a split-belt
              treadmill which has belts that move at different speeds, they
              adapt to the asymmetric speed constraints by reducing their
              spatiotemporal asymmetry. Here, we aim to understand the role of
              stability as a potential factor driving this adaptation process.
              We recruited 24 healthy, young adults to adapt to walking on a
              split-belt treadmill while either holding on to a handrail or
              walking with free arm swing. We measured whole-body angular
              momentum and step length asymmetry as measures of dynamic balance
              and spatiotemporal asymmetry, respectively. To understand how
              changes in intersegmental coordination influenced measures of
              dynamic balance, we also measured segmental angular momenta and
              the coefficient of limb cancellation. When participants were
              initially exposed to the asymmetry in belt speeds, we observed an
              increase in whole-body angular momentum that was due to both an
              increase in the momentum of individual limb segments and a
              reduction in limb cancellation. Holding on to a handrail reduced
              the perturbation to asymmetry during the early phase of
              adaptation and resulted in a smaller after-effect during
              post-adaptation. In addition, the stabilization provided by
              holding on to a handrail led to reductions in the coupling
              between angular momentum and asymmetry. These results suggest
              that regulation of dynamic balance is most important during the
              initial, transient phase of adaptation to walking on a split-belt
              treadmill.",

  abstract = "Neural control of standing balance has been extensively studied.
              However, most falls occur during walking rather than standing,
              and findings from standing balance research do not necessarily
              carry over to walking. This is primarily due to the constraints
              of the gait cycle: Body configuration changes dramatically over
              the gait cycle, necessitating different responses as this
              configuration changes. Notably, certain responses can only be
              initiated at specific points in the gait cycle, leading to onset
              times ranging from 350 to 600 ms, much longer than what is
              observed during standing (50-200 ms). Here, we investigated the
              neural control of upright balance during walking. Specifically,
              how the brain transforms sensory information related to upright
              balance into corrective motor responses. We used visual
              disturbances of 20 healthy young subjects walking in a virtual
              reality cave to induce the perception of a fall to the side and
              analyzed the muscular responses, changes in ground reaction
              forces and body kinematics. Our results showed changes in swing
              leg foot placement and stance leg ankle roll that accelerate the
              body in the direction opposite of the visually induced fall
              stimulus, consistent with previous results. Surprisingly, ankle
              musculature activity changed rapidly in response to the stimulus,
              suggesting the presence of a direct reflexive pathway from the
              visual system to the spinal cord, similar to the vestibulospinal
              pathway. We also observed systematic modulation of the ankle
              push-off, indicating the discovery of a previously unobserved
              balance mechanism. Such modulation has implications not only for
              balance but plays a role in modulation of step width and length
              as well as cadence. These results indicated a
              temporally-coordinated series of balance responses over the gait
              cycle that insures flexible control of upright balance during
              walking.",

  abstract = "Many theories of motor control suggest that we select our
              movements to reduce energy use. However, it is unclear whether
              this process underlies short-term motor adaptation to novel
              environments. Here we asked whether adaptation to walking on a
              split-belt treadmill leads to a more economical walking pattern.
              We hypothesized that adaptation would be accompanied by a
              reduction in metabolic power and muscle activity and that these
              reductions would be temporally correlated. Eleven individuals
              performed a split-belt adaptation task where the belt speeds were
              set at 0.5 and 1.5 m s(-1). Adaptation was characterized by step
              length symmetry, which is the normalized difference in step
              length between the legs. Metabolic power was calculated based on
              expired gas analysis, and surface EMG was used to record the
              activity of four bilateral leg muscles (tibialis anterior,
              lateral gastrocnemius, vastus lateralis and biceps femoris). All
              participants initially walked with unequal step lengths when the
              belts moved at different speeds, but gradually adapted to take
              steps of equal length. Additionally, net metabolic power was
              reduced from early adaptation to late adaptation (early, 3.78
              $\pm$ 1.05 W kg(-1); and late, 3.05 $\pm$ 0.79 W kg(-1); P <
              0.001). This reduction in power was also accompanied by a
              bilateral reduction in EMG throughout the gait cycle.
              Furthermore, the reductions in metabolic power occurred over the
              same time scale as the improvements in step length symmetry, and
              the magnitude of these improvements predicted the size of the
              reduction in metabolic power. Our results suggest that increasing
              economy may be a key criterion driving locomotor adaptation.",

  abstract = "Center of mass (COM) control has been proposed to serve economy-
              and stability-related locomotor task objectives. However, given
              the lack of evidence supporting direct sensing and/or regulation
              of the COM, it remains unclear whether COM mechanics are
              prioritized in the control scheme of walking. We posit that
              peripheral musculoskeletal structures, e.g. muscle, are more
              realistic control targets than the COM, given their abundance of
              sensorimotor receptors and ability to influence whole-body
              energetics. As a first test of this hypothesis, we examined
              whether conservation of stance-phase joint mechanics is
              prioritized over COM mechanics in a locomotor task where
              simultaneous conservation of COM and joint mechanics is not
              feasible: imposed leg-length asymmetry. Positive joint mechanical
              cost of transport (work per distance traveled; COTJNT) was
              maintained at values closer to normal walking than COM mechanical
              cost of transport (COTCOM; P<0.05, N=15). Furthermore, compared
              with our measures of COM mechanics (COTCOM, COM displacement),
              joint-level variables (COTJNT, integrated total support moment)
              also displayed stronger conservation (less change from normal
              walking) when the participants' self-selected gait was assessed
              against other possible gait solutions. We conclude that when
              walking humans are exposed to an asymmetric leg-length
              perturbation, control of joint mechanics is prioritized over COM
              mechanics. Our results suggest that mechanical and metabolic
              effort is likely regulated via control of peripheral structures
              and not directly at the level of the COM. Joint mechanics may
              provide a more accurate representation of the underlying
              locomotor control targets and may prove advantageous in informing
              predictive models of human walking.",

              long-term, continuous perturbations. We examined how dynamic
              balance control adapts to a continuous perturbation in gait, by
              letting people walk faster with one leg than the other on a
              treadmill with two belts (i.e. split-belt walking). In addition,
              we assessed whether changes in mediolateral dynamic balance
              control coincide with changes in energy use during split-belt
              adaptation. In 9 min of split-belt gait, mediolateral margins of
              stability and mediolateral foot roll-off changed during
              adaptation to the imposed gait asymmetry, especially on the fast
              side, and returned to baseline during washout. Interestingly, no
              changes in mediolateral foot placement (i.e. step width) were

              throughout the gait cycle. Consistent with previous results, net
              metabolic power was reduced during split-belt adaptation, but
              changes in mediolateral dynamic balance control were not
              correlated with the reduction of net metabolic power during

              mediolateral foot roll-off adapts to continuously imposed gait
              asymmetry to maintain dynamic balance in human bipedal gait.",

              on gait and balance performance compared with standard treadmill
              training. METHODS: In this single-blind randomized controlled
              trial, 43 PD patients (Hoehn \& Yahr stage 1-3.5) were assigned
              to either an 8-week perturbed treadmill intervention (n = 21) or
              a control group (n = 22) training on the identical treadmill
              without perturbations. Patients were assessed at baseline,
              postintervention, and at 3 months' follow-up. Primary endpoints
              were overground gait speed and balance (Mini-BESTest). Secondary
              outcomes included fast gait speed, walking capacity (2-Minute
              Walk Test), dynamic balance (Timed Up-and-Go), static balance
              (postural sway), and balance confidence (Activities-Specific
              Balance Confidence [ABC] scale). RESULTS: There were no
              significant between-group differences in change over time for the
              primary outcomes. At postintervention, both groups demonstrated
              similar improvements in overground gait speed ( P = .009), and no
              changes in the Mini-BESTest ( P = .641). A significant
              group-by-time interaction ( P = .048) existed for the Timed

              involve a metabolic cost in healthy subjects, but it is unclear
              how this cost changes as a function of postural threat. The aim

              threat on the energy cost of walking, as well as on concomitant
              changes in spatiotemporal gait parameters, muscle activity and
              perturbation responses. In addition, we examined if and how these
              effects are dependent on walking speed. METHODS: Healthy subjects
              walked on a treadmill under four conditions of varying postural
              threat. Each condition was performed at 7 walking speeds ranging
              from 60-140\% of preferred speed. Postural threat was induced by
              applying unexpected sideward pulls to the pelvis and varied
              experimentally by manipulating the width of the path subjects had
              to walk on. RESULTS: Results showed that the energy cost of
              walking increased by 6-13\% in the two conditions with the
              largest postural threat. This increase in metabolic demand was
              accompanied by adaptations in spatiotemporal gait parameters and
              increases in muscle activity, which likely served to arm the
              participants against a potential loss of balance in the face of
              the postural threat. Perturbation responses exhibited a slower
              rate of recovery in high threat conditions, probably reflecting a
              change in strategy to cope with the imposed constraints. The
              observed changes occurred independent of changes in walking
              speed, suggesting that walking speed is not a major determinant
              influencing gait stability in healthy young adults. CONCLUSIONS:
              The current study shows that in healthy adults, increasing
              postural threat leads to a decrease in gait economy, independent
              of walking speed. This could be an important factor in the
              elevated energy costs of pathological gait.",

               of the Hoehn and Yahr Scale were randomized into one of two
               groups, stratified by disease severity: The experimental group
               (n=19) walked on a treadmill prototype which constantly applied
               perturbation by small three-dimensional tilting movements of the
               walking surface. The control group (n=20) trained on the
               identical treadmill without perturbations. Patients walked on
               the treadmill for 20min. Primary outcome measure was overground
               walking speed. Secondary outcomes were postural sway during
               quiet standing and spatiotemporal gait parameters during
               treadmill walking. Outcomes were measured repeatedly throughout
               the training session and after 10min retention. The experimental
               group significantly increased overground walking speed after
               intervention compared to the control group (p=0.014; ES=+0.41).
               Gait variability during treadmill walking significantly

               with treadmill walking only in the control group (p=0.009;
               ES=+0.49). No other postural sway measures changed over time.
               Subgroup analyses revealed that in the experimental group
               patients with more pronounced motor impairment demonstrated
               larger increases in overground walking speed (p=0.016; ES=+0.40)
               and stance phase symmetry (p=0.011; ES=-0.42). In conclusion, a
               single session of perturbation treadmill training led to gait
               improvements, which were more pronounced compared to unperturbed
               treadmill walking. Effects on static postural sway were less
               pronounced.",

               paradigms are often used to identify dysfunction associated with

               most reliable for detecting and tracking responses to

               of temporal-spatial, kinematic variability, and dynamic
               stability measures during three types of perturbed gait. Twenty
               young healthy adults completed two identical testing sessions
               two weeks apart, comprised of an unperturbed and three perturbed
               (cognitive, physical, and visual) walking conditions in a
               virtual reality environment. Within each session, perturbation
               responses were compared to unperturbed walking using paired
               t-tests. Between-session reliability and minimum detectable
               change values were also calculated for each measure and
               condition. All temporal-spatial, kinematic variability and
               dynamic stability measures demonstrated fair to excellent
               between-session reliability. Minimal detectable change values,
               normalized to mean values ranged from 1-50\%. Step width mean
               and variability measures demonstrated the greatest response to
               perturbations with excellent between-session reliability and low
               minimum detectable change values. Orbital stability measures
               demonstrated specificity to perturbation direction and
               sensitivity with excellent between-session reliability and low
               minimum detectable change values. We observed substantially
               greater between-session reliability and lower minimum detectable
               change values for local stability measures than previously
               described which may be the result of averaging across trials
               within a session and using velocity versus acceleration data for
               reconstruction of state spaces. Across all perturbation types,
               temporal-spatial, orbital and local measures were the most
               reliable measures with the lowest minimum detectable change
               values, supporting their use for tracking changes over multiple
               testing sessions. The between-session reliability and minimum
               detectable change values reported here provide an objective
               means for interpreting changes in temporal-spatial, kinematic
               variability, and dynamic stability measures during perturbed
               walking which may assist in identifying instability.",

               may be effective in improving reactive balance control and/or
               reducing fall risk in individuals with stroke, the
               characteristics of reactive balance responses that improve
               following PBT have not yet been identified. This study aimed to
               determine if reactive stepping characteristics and timing in
               response to support-surface perturbations improved to a greater
               extent following PBT, compared to traditional balance training.
               MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study represents a substudy of a
               multisite randomized controlled trial. Sixteen individuals with
               chronic stroke were randomly assigned to either
               perturbation-based or traditional balance training, and
               underwent 6-weeks of training as a part of the randomized
               controlled trial. Responses to support-surface perturbation were
               evaluated pre- and post-training, and 6-months post-training.
               Reactive stepping characteristics and timing were compared
               between sessions within each group, and between groups at
               post-training and 6-months post-training while controlling for
               each measure at the pre-training session. RESULTS: The frequency
               of extra steps in response to perturbations decreased from
               pre-training to post-training for the PBT group, but not for the
               control group. CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in reactive balance
               control were identified after PBT in individuals with chronic
               stroke. Findings provide insight into the mechanism by which PBT
               improves reactive balance control poststroke, and support the
               use of PBT in balance rehabilitation programs poststroke.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: For stroke survivors, balance deficits that persist
               after the completion of the rehabilitation process lead to a
               significant risk of falls. We have recently developed a
               balance-assessment robot (BAR-TM) that enables assessment of
               balancing abilities during walking. The purpose of this study
               was to test feasibility of using the BAR-TM in an experimental
               perturbed-balance training program with a selected
               high-functioning stroke survivor. METHODS: A control and an
               individual with right-side chronic hemiparesis post-stroke were
               studied. The individual post-stroke underwent thirty sessions of
               balance-perturbed training that involved walking on an
               instrumented treadmill while the BAR-TM delivered random pushes
               to the participant's pelvis; these pushes were in various
               directions, at various speeds, and had various perturbation
               amplitudes. We assessed kinematics, kinetics, electromyography,
               and spatio-temporal responses to outward-directed perturbations
               of amplitude 60 N (before training) and 60 N and 90 N (after
               training) commencing on contact of either the nonparetic-left
               foot (LL-NP/L perturbation) or the paretic-right foot (RR-P/R
               perturbation) while the treadmill was running at a speed of 0.4
               m/s. RESULTS: Before training, the individual post-stroke
               primarily responded to LL-NP/L perturbations with an in-stance
               response on the non-paretic leg in a similar way to the control
               participant. After training, the individual post-stroke added
               adequate stepping by making a cross-step with the paretic leg
               that enabled successful rejection of the perturbation at lower
               and higher amplitudes. Before training, the individual
               post-stroke primarily responded to RR-P/R perturbations with
               fast cross-stepping using the left, non-paretic leg while
               in-stance response was entirely missing. After training, the
               stepping with the non-paretic leg was supplemented by partially
               recovered ability to exercise in-stance responses on the paretic
               leg and this enabled successful rejection of the perturbation at
               lower and higher amplitudes. The assessed kinematics, kinetics,
               electromyography, and spatio-temporal responses provided insight
               into the relative share of each balancing strategy that the
               selected individual post-stroke used to counteract LL-NP/L and
               RR-P/R perturbations before and after the training. CONCLUSIONS:
               The main finding of this case-control study is that robot-based
               perturbed-balance training may be a feasible approach. It
               resulted in an improvement the selected post-stroke
               participant's ability to counteract outward-directed

               training (PBT) can reduce falls in daily life among individuals
               with chronic stroke. DESIGN: Assessor-blinded randomised
               controlled trial. SETTING: Two academic hospitals in an urban
               area. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were allocated using
               stratified blocked randomisation to either 'traditional' balance
               training (control) or PBT. PBT focused on improving responses to
               instability, whereas traditional balance training focused on
               maintaining stability during functional tasks. Training sessions
               were 1 hour twice/week for 6 weeks. Participants were also
               invited to complete 2 'booster' training sessions during the
               follow-up. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-eight participants with chronic
               stroke (>6 months poststroke) were recruited and randomly
               allocated one of the two interventions. Five participants
               withdrew; 42 (control) and 41 (PBT group) were included in the
               analysis. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary
               outcome was rate of falls in the 12 months post-training.
               Negative binomial regression was used to compare fall rates
               between groups. Secondary outcomes were measures of balance,
               mobility, balance confidence, physical activity and social
               integration. RESULTS: PBT participants reported 53 falls (1.45
               falls/person-year) and control participants reported 64 falls
               (1.72 falls/person-year; rate ratio: 0.85(0.42 to 1.69);
               p=0.63). Per-protocol analysis included 32 PBT and 34 control
               participants who completed at least 10/12 initial training
               sessions and 1 booster session. Within this subset, PBT
               participants reported 32 falls (1.07 falls/person-year) and
               control participants reported 57 falls (1.75 falls/person-year;
               rate ratio: 0.62(0.29 to 1.30); p=0.20). PBT participants had
               greater improvement in reactive balance control than the control
               group, and these improvements were sustained 12 months
               post-training. There were no intervention-related serious
               adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: The results are inconclusive. PBT
               may help to prevent falls in daily life poststroke, but ongoing
               training may be required to maintain the benefits. TRIAL

              electroencephalography (EEG) recorded from able-bodied volunteers
              during a novel treadmill walking paradigm was used to assess
              neural correlates of walking. A systematic processing method,
              including a recently developed subspace reconstruction algorithm,
              reduced movement-related EEG artifact prior to independent
              component analysis and dipole source localization. We quantified
              cortical activity while participants tracked slow and fast target
              speeds across two treadmill conditions: an active mode that
              adjusted belt speed based on user movements and a passive mode
              reflecting a typical treadmill. Our results reveal frequency
              specific, multi-focal task related changes in cortical
              oscillations elicited by active walking. Low $\gamma$ band power,
              localized to the prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices, was
              significantly increased during double support and early swing
              phases, critical points in the gait cycle since the active
              controller adjusted speed based on pelvis position and swing foot
              velocity. These phasic $\gamma$ band synchronizations provide
              evidence that prefrontal and posterior parietal networks,
              previously implicated in visuo-spatial and somotosensory
              integration, are engaged to enhance lower limb control during
              gait. Sustained $\mu$ and $\beta$ band desynchronization within
              sensorimotor cortex, a neural correlate for movement, was
              observed during walking thereby validating our methods for
              isolating cortical activity. Our results also demonstrate the
              utility of EEG recorded during locomotion for probing the
              multi-regional cortical networks which underpin its execution.
              For example, the cortical network engagement elicited by the
              active treadmill suggests that it may enhance neuroplasticity for
              more effective motor training.",

               multiple single-unit activities (SUAs) recorded in nonhuman

               speed while receiving visual feedback of their lower limbs
               (i.e., precision walking), to repeatedly avoid stepping on a

               control including a potentially important role for the cerebral

               measurement associated with moments of induced instability as

  abstract  = "The role of cortical activity in standing balance is unclear.
               Here we tested whether perturbation-evoked cortical responses
               share sensory input with simultaneous balance-correcting muscle
               responses. We hypothesized that the acceleration-dependent
               somatosensory signals that drive the initial burst of the muscle
               automatic postural response also drive the simultaneous
               perturbation-evoked cortical N1 response. We measured in healthy
               young adults ( n = 16) the initial burst of the muscle automatic
               postural response (100-200 ms), startle-related muscle responses
               (100-200 ms), and the perturbation-evoked cortical N1 potential,
               i.e., a negative peak in cortical EEG activity (100-200 ms) over
               the supplementary motor area. Forward and backward translational
               support-surface balance perturbations were applied at four
               levels of acceleration and were unpredictable in timing,
               direction, and acceleration. Our results from averaged and
               single-trial analyses suggest that although cortical and muscle
               responses are evoked by the same perturbation stimulus, their
               amplitudes are independently modulated. Although both muscle and
               cortical responses increase with acceleration, correlations
               between single-trial muscle and cortical responses were very
               weak. Furthermore, across subjects, the scaling of muscle
               responses to acceleration did not correspond to scaling of
               cortical responses to acceleration. Moreover, we observed a
               reduction in cortical response amplitude across trials that was
               related to a reduction in startle-related-but not
               balance-correcting-muscle activity. Therefore, cortical response
               attenuation may be related to a reduction in perceived threat
               rather than motor adaptation or changes in sensory inflow. We
               conclude that the cortical N1 reflects integrated sensory inputs
               simultaneously related to brain stem-mediated balance-correcting
               muscle responses and startle reflexes. NEW \& NOTEWORTHY
               Reactive balance recovery requires sensory inputs to be
               transformed into appropriate balance-correcting motor responses
               via brain stem circuits; these are accompanied by simultaneous
               and poorly understood cortical responses. We used single-trial
               analyses to dissociate muscle and cortical response modulation
               with perturbation acceleration. Although muscle and cortical
               responses share sensory inputs, they have independent scaling
               mechanisms. Attenuation of cortical responses with experience
               reflected attenuation of brain stem-mediated startle responses
               rather than the amplitude of balance-correcting motor responses.",

               closed-loop BCI systems for the control of a lower body
               exoskeleton has been recently shown, multi-day closed-loop
               neural decoding of human gait in a BCI virtual reality (BCI-VR)
               environment has yet to be demonstrated. BCI-VR systems provide

               robots are not desirable due to medical conditions, cost,

               lower limb joint angles from scalp electroencephalography (EEG)

               cortical potentials of EEG in the delta band (0.1-3 Hz) were
               used for prediction; thus, the EEG features correspond to
               time-domain amplitude modulated potentials in the delta band.

               walking avatar under normal and altered visuomotor
               perturbations, which involved cortical adaptations. The average
               decoding accuracies (Pearson's r values) in real-time BCI across
               all subjects increased from (Hip: 0.18 $\pm$ 0.31; Knee: 0.23

                   component analysis (ICA) has been shown to isolate the
                   various source generator processes underlying those
                   recordings. Independent components (IC) found by ICA
                   decomposition can be manually inspected, selected, and
                   interpreted, but doing so requires both time and practice as
                   ICs have no particular order or intrinsic interpretations
                   and therefore require further study of their properties.
                   Alternatively, sufficiently-accurate automated IC
                   classifiers can be used to classify ICs into broad source
                   categories, speeding the analysis of EEG studies with many
                   subjects and enabling the use of ICA decomposition in
                   near-real-time applications. While many such classifiers
                   have been proposed recently, this work presents the ICLabel
                   project comprised of (1) an IC dataset containing
                   spatiotemporal measures for over 200,000 ICs from more than
                   6,000 EEG recordings, (2) a website for collecting
                   crowdsourced IC labels and educating EEG researchers and
                   practitioners about IC interpretation, and (3) the automated
                   ICLabel classifier. The classifier improves upon existing
                   methods in two ways: by improving the accuracy of the
                   computed label estimates and by enhancing its computational
                   efficiency. The ICLabel classifier outperforms or performs

  abstract = "Large, unlabeled datasets are abundant nowadays, but getting
              labels for those datasets can be expensive and time-consuming.
              Crowd labeling is a crowdsourcing approach for gathering such
              labels from workers whose suggestions are not always accurate.
              While a variety of algorithms exist for this purpose, we present
              crowd labeling latent Dirichlet allocation (CL-LDA), a
              generalization of latent Dirichlet allocation that can solve a
              more general set of crowd labeling problems. We show that it
              performs as well as other methods and at times better on a
              variety of simulated and actual datasets while treating each
              label as compositional rather than indicating a discrete class.
              In addition, prior knowledge of workers' abilities can be
              incorporated into the model through a structured Bayesian
              framework. We then apply CL-LDA to the EEG independent component
              labeling dataset, using its generalizations to further explore
              the utility of the algorithm. We discuss prospects for creating
              classifiers from the generated labels.",

  abstract = "Muscle synergy analysis (MSA) is a mathematical technique that
              reduces the dimensionality of electromyographic (EMG) data. Used
              increasingly in biomechanics research, MSA requires
              methodological choices at each stage of the analysis. Differences
              in methodological steps affect the overall outcome, making it
              difficult to compare results across studies. We applied MSA to
              EMG data collected from individuals post-stroke identified as
              either responders (RES) or non-responders (nRES) on the basis of
              a critical post-treatment increase in walking speed. Importantly,
              no clinical or functional indicators identified differences
              between the cohort of RES and nRES at baseline. For this
              exploratory study, we selected the five highest RES and five
              lowest nRES available from a larger sample. Our goal was to
              assess how the methodological choices made before, during, and
              after MSA affect the ability to differentiate two groups with
              intrinsic physiologic differences based on MSA results. We
              investigated 30 variations in MSA methodology to determine which
              choices allowed differentiation of RES from nRES at baseline.
              Trial-to-trial variability in time-independent synergy vectors
              (SVs) and time-varying neural commands (NCs) were measured as a
              function of: (1) number of synergies computed; (2) EMG
              normalization method before MSA; (3) whether SVs were held
              constant across trials or allowed to vary during MSA; and (4)
              synergy analysis output normalization method after MSA. MSA
              methodology had a strong effect on our ability to differentiate
              RES from nRES at baseline. Across all 10 individuals and MSA
              variations, two synergies were needed to reach an average of 90\%
              variance accounted for (VAF). Based on effect sizes, differences
              in SV and NC variability between groups were greatest using two
              synergies with SVs that varied from trial-to-trial. Differences
              in SV variability were clearest using unit magnitude per trial
              EMG normalization, while NC variability was less sensitive to EMG
              normalization method. No outcomes were greatly impacted by output
              normalization method. MSA variability for some, but not all,
              methods successfully differentiated intrinsic physiological
              differences inaccessible to traditional clinical or biomechanical
              assessments. Our results were sensitive to methodological
              choices, highlighting the need for disclosure of all aspects of
              MSA methodology in future studies.",

               also known that head movement creates motion artifacts in fNIRS
               data. The aim of this study was to investigate cortical
               activation during forward and backward walking, while also
               measuring head movement. We hypothesized that greater activation
               in motor areas while walking backward would be concurrent with
               increased head movement. Participants performed forward and
               backward walking on a treadmill. Participants wore motion
               capture markers on their head to quantify head movement and
               pressure sensors on their feet to calculate stride-time. fNIRS
               was placed over motor areas of the cortex to measure cortical
               activation. Measurements were compared for forward and backward

               walking conditions, suggesting that conditional differences in
               movement did not influence fNIRS results. Stride-time was
               significantly shorter during backward walking than during
               forward walking, but not more variable. There were no
               differences in activation for motor areas of the cortex when
               outliers were removed. However, there was a positive correlation
               between stride-time variability and activation in the primary
               motor cortex. This positive correlation between motor cortex
               activation and stride-time variability suggests that forward

               growing in recent years, particularly in relation to
               understanding gait disturbances. Movement artefacts (MA) in EEG
               signals originate from mechanical forces applied to the scalp
               electrodes, inducing small electrode movements relative to the
               scalp which, in turn, cause the recorded voltage to change
               irrespectively of cortical activity. These mechanical forces,
               and thus MA, may have various sources (e.g., ground reaction
               forces, head movements, etc.) that are inherent to daily
               activities, notably walking. In this paper we introduce a
               systematic, integrated methodology for removing MA from EEG
               signals recorded during treadmill (TM) and over-ground (OG)
               walking, as well as quantify the prevalence of MA in different
               locomotion settings. In our experiments, participants performed
               walking trials at various speeds both OG and on a TM while
               wearing a 32-channel EEG cap and a 3-axis accelerometer, placed
               on the forehead. Data preprocessing included separating the EEG
               signals into statistically independent additive components using
               independent component analysis (ICA). We observed an increase in
               electro-physiological signals (e.g., neck EMG activations for
               stabilizing the head during heel-strikes) as the walking speed
               increased. These artefact independent-components (ICs), while
               not originating from electrode movement, still exhibit a similar
               spectral pattern to the MA ICs-a peak at the stepping frequency.
               MA was identified and quantified in each component using a novel
               method that utilizes the participant's stepping frequency,
               derived from a forehead-mounted accelerometer. We then
               benchmarked the EEG data by applying newly established metrics
               to quantify the success of our method in cleaning the data. The
               results indicate that our approach can be successfully applied
               to EEG data recorded during TM and OG walking, and is offered as
               a unified methodology for MA removal from EEG collected during
               gait trials.",

               normal ageing process affects an individual's ability to learn
               and retain a motor skill, but spares their ability to transfer
               the skill to the untrained, opposite limb. While this phenomenon
               has been well-studied in the upper-extremity, evidence in the
               lower-extremity is limited. Further, it is unclear to what
               extent age-related differences in motor learning and transfer
               are dependent on visual feedback of the motor task. Therefore,
               the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of ageing
               on motor learning, retention, and interlimb transfer during
               walking with and without visual feedback. Forty-four subjects
               (24 young; 20 older adults) were tested on a treadmill over two
               consecutive days. On day 1, subjects learned a new gait pattern
               by performing a foot-trajectory tracking task that necessitated
               greater hip and knee flexion during the swing phase of the gait.
               On day 2, subjects repeated the task with their training leg to
               test retention, then with their untrained leg to test interlimb
               transfer. Trials without visual feedback were also collected on
               both days. Results indicated that older adults had reduced
               ability to learn the task, and also exhibited lower retention
               and inter-limb transfer. However, these differences were
               dependent on visual feedback as the groups performed similarly
               when feedback was removed. The findings provide novel evidence
               indicating that ageing impairs learning, retention, and transfer
               of motor skills in the lower-extremity during walking, which may

               individuals. These findings indicate age-related changes in the

               suggests reduced cortical input to spinal motor neurons in older

               multiple changes in electrophysiological measures at low-gamma
               frequencies during treadmill compared to overground walking,
               indicating task-dependent differences in corticospinal locomotor
               control. These findings may be affected by artefacts and should
               be interpreted with caution.",

               deficits. Using a model-based approach, we aimed to identify
               which of these deficits mainly determine age-related changes in
               postural control. We analyzed postural control of 20 healthy
               elderly people with a mean age of 74 years. The findings were
               compared to data from 19 healthy young volunteers (mean age 28
               years) and 16 healthy middle-aged volunteers (mean age 48
               years). Postural control was characterized by spontaneous sway
               measures and measures of perturbed stance. Perturbations were
               induced by pseudorandom anterior-posterior tilts of the body
               support surface. We found that spontaneous sway amplitude and
               velocity were significantly larger, and sway frequencies were
               higher in elderly compared to young people. Body excursions as a
               function of tilt stimuli were clearly different in elderly
               compared to young people. Based on simple feedback model
               simulations, we found that elderly favor proprioceptive over
               visual and vestibular cues, other than younger subjects do.
               Moreover, we identified an increase in overall time delay
               challenging the feedback systems stability, and a decline in the
               amplitude of the motor feedback, probably representing weakness
               of the motor system. In general, these parameter differences
               between young and old may result from both deficits and
               compensation strategies in the elderly. Our model-based findings
               correlate well with deficits measured with clinical balance
               scores, which are widely used in clinical practice.",

  abstract      = "Electroencephalography (EEG) is a complex signal and can
                   require several years of training to be correctly
                   interpreted. Recently, deep learning (DL) has shown great
                   promise in helping make sense of EEG signals due to its
                   capacity to learn good feature representations from raw
                   data. Whether DL truly presents advantages as compared to
                   more traditional EEG processing approaches, however, remains
                   an open question. In this work, we review 156 papers that
                   apply DL to EEG, published between January 2010 and July
                   2018, and spanning different application domains such as
                   epilepsy, sleep, brain-computer interfacing, and cognitive
                   and affective monitoring. We extract trends and highlight
                   interesting approaches in order to inform future research
                   and formulate recommendations. Various data items were
                   extracted for each study pertaining to 1) the data, 2) the
                   preprocessing methodology, 3) the DL design choices, 4) the
                   results, and 5) the reproducibility of the experiments. Our
                   analysis reveals that the amount of EEG data used across
                   studies varies from less than ten minutes to thousands of
                   hours. As for the model, 40\% of the studies used
                   convolutional neural networks (CNNs), while 14\% used
                   recurrent neural networks (RNNs), most often with a total of
                   3 to 10 layers. Moreover, almost one-half of the studies
                   trained their models on raw or preprocessed EEG time series.
                   Finally, the median gain in accuracy of DL approaches over
                   traditional baselines was 5.4\% across all relevant studies.
                   More importantly, however, we noticed studies often suffer
                   from poor reproducibility: a majority of papers would be
                   hard or impossible to reproduce given the unavailability of
                   their data and code. To help the field progress, we provide
                   a list of recommendations for future studies and we make our
                   summary table of DL and EEG papers available and invite the

  abstract  = "Ocular artifacts (OAs) are one the most important form of
               interferences in the analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG)
               research. OAs removal/reduction is a key analysis before the
               processing of EEG signals. For classic OAs removal methods,
               either an additional electrooculogram (EOG) recording or
               multi-channel EEG is required. To address these limitations of
               existing methods, this paper investigates the use of deep
               learning network (DLN) to remove OAs in EEG signals. The
               proposed method consists of offline stage and online stage. In
               the offline stage, training samples without OAs are intercepted
               and used to train an DLN to reconstruct the EEG signals. The
               high-order statistical moments information of EEG is therefore
               learned. In the online stage, the trained DLN is used as a
               filter to automatically remove OAs from the contaminated EEG
               signals. Compared with the exiting methods, the proposed method
               has the following advantages: (i) nonuse of additional EOG
               reference signals, (ii) any few number of EEG channels can be
               analyzed, (iii) time saving, and (iv) the strong generalization
               ability, etc. In this paper, both public database and lab
               individual data for EEG analysis are used, we compared the
               proposed method with the classic independent component analysis
               (ICA), kurtosis-ICA (K-ICA), Second-order blind identification
               (SOBI) and a shallow network method. Experimental results show
               that the proposed method performs better even for very noisy

  abstract  = "Cortical involvement in postural control is well recognized,
               however the role of non-visual afferents remains unclear.
               Parietal cortical areas are strongly implicated in
               vestibulo-spatial functions, but topographical localization
               during balance tasks remains limited. Here, we use
               electroencephalography (EEG) during continuous balance tasks of
               increasing difficulty at single electrode positions. Twenty-four
               healthy, right-handed individuals performed four balance tasks
               of increasing difficulty (bipedal and unipedal) and a seated
               control condition with eyes closed. Subjective ratings of task
               difficulty were obtained. EEG was recorded from 32 electrodes; 5
               overlying sensory and motor regions of interest (ROIs) were
               chosen for further investigation: C3, Cz, C4, P3, P4. Spectral
               power and coherence during balance tasks were analyzed in theta
               (4-8 Hz) and alpha (8-12 Hz) bands. Alpha power reduced as task
               difficulty increased and this reduction correlated with
               subjective difficulty ratings. Alpha coherence increased with
               task difficulty between C3-Cz-C4 electrode pairs. Differential
               changes in power were observed in Cz, suggestive of a distinct
               role at this electrode location, which captures lower limb
               cortical representation. Hemispheric asymmetry was observed, as
               reflected by greater reductions in theta and alpha power in
               right-sided areas. Our results demonstrate the functional
               importance of bilateral central and parietal cortices in
               continuous balance control. The hemispheric asymmetry observed
               implies that the non-dominant hemisphere is involved with online
               monitoring of postural control. Although the posterior parietal
               asymmetry found may relate to vestibular, somatosensory or
               multisensory feedback processing, we argue that the finding
               relates to active balance control rather than simple
               sensory-intake or reflex circuit activation.",

  author    = "Peterson, Steven M and Rios, Estefania and Ferris, Daniel P",
  abstract  = "Immersive virtual reality can expose humans to novel training
               and sensory environments, but motor training with virtual
               reality has not been able to improve motor performance as much
               as motor training in real-world conditions. An advantage of
               immersive virtual reality that has not been fully leveraged is
               that it can introduce transient visual perturbations on top of
               the visual environment being displayed. The goal of this study
               was to determine whether transient visual perturbations
               introduced in immersive virtual reality modify electrocortical
               activity and behavioral outcomes in human subjects practicing a
               novel balancing task during walking. We studied three groups of
               healthy young adults (5 male and 5 female for each) while they
               learned a balance beam walking task for 30 min under different
               conditions. Two groups trained while wearing a virtual reality
               headset, and one of those groups also had half-second visual
               rotation perturbations lasting ~10\% of the training time. The
               third group trained without virtual reality. We recorded
               high-density electroencephalography (EEG) and movement
               kinematics. We hypothesized that virtual reality training with
               perturbations would increase electrocortical activity and
               improve balance performance compared with virtual reality
               training without perturbations. Our results confirmed the
               hypothesis. Brief visual perturbations induced increased theta
               spectral power and decreased alpha spectral power in parietal
               and occipital regions and improved balance performance in
               posttesting. Our findings indicate that transient visual
               perturbations during immersive virtual reality training can
               boost short-term motor learning by inducing a cognitive change,
               minimizing the negative effects of virtual reality on motor
               training. NEW \& NOTEWORTHY We found that transient visual
               perturbations in virtual reality during balance training can
               boost short-term motor learning by inducing a cognitive change,
               overcoming the negative effects of immersive virtual reality. As
               a result, subjects training in immersive virtual reality with
               visual perturbations have equivalent performance improvement as
               training in real-world conditions. Visual perturbations elicited
               cortical responses in occipital and parietal regions and may
               have improved the brain's ability to adapt to variations in

  abstract  = "This study examined differences between young and elderly
               volunteers in cortical involvement to human posture control
               during quiet stance with normal and altered sensory stimulation
               (Experiment-1), and biomechanical perturbations (Experiment-2).
               The primary focus of the first part was to monitor changes in
               cortical activity when unexpectedly altering the sensory
               conditions of upright stance, such as switching from stable
               (eyes open, fixed support surface) to less-stable (eyes closed,
               sway-referenced support surface) conditions. Our results
               demonstrate increased cortical activations in delta (0.2-4 Hz)
               and gamma (30-50 Hz) oscillations, primarily over
               central-frontal, central, and central parietal cortices during
               challenging postural conditions. While increased delta rhythms
               were observed in both groups during challenging sensory
               conditions, elderly individuals also showed increased gamma band
               activity over sensorimotor and parietal cortices, when compared
               to the younger group. To our knowledge, this study is the first
               to show age differences in balance related cortical activations
               during continuous postural tasks with challenging sensory
               conditions. Preliminary correlations also suggest that increased
               cerebral activity became more relevant to the control of Center
               of Mass (COM) dynamics when upright stance is threatened. The
               results of Experiment-2 also showed for the first time that
               oscillatory rhythms of the cortex are coherent with muscle
               firing characteristics suggesting increased corticospinal drive
               from leg motor cortex to lower limb motoneurons following
               postural perturbations. Finally, perturbation evoked potential
               (PEP) analyses suggest that, rather than motor system
               malfunctioning, impairments in perceptual processing of sensory
               afference forms the basis of prolonged muscle response delays
               during perturbed balance in the elderly.",

               followed by 10 min of over-ground walking in each session for 4
               to 6 weeks. The outcomes included alpha event-related

               training. The results (n =6 for each group) showed that both the

  abstract  = "Background: Behavioral evidence for cortical involvement in
               reactive balance control in response to environmental
               perturbation is established, however, the neural correlates are
               not known. This study aimed to examine the neural mechanisms
               involved in reactive balance control for recovery from slip-like
               perturbations using mental imagery and to evaluate the
               difference in activation patterns between imagined and observed
               slipping. Methods: Ten healthy young participants after an
               exposure to regular walking and slip-perturbation trial on a
               treadmill, performed mental imagery and observation tasks in the
               MR scanner. Participants received verbal instructions to imagine
               walking (IW), observe walking (OW), imagine slipping (IS) and
               observe slipping (OS) while walking. Results: Analysis using
               general linear model showed increased activation during IS
               versus IW condition in precentral gyrus, middle frontal gyrus,
               superior, middle and transverse temporal gyrus, parahippocampal
               gyrus, cingulate gyrus, insula, pulvinar nucleus of the
               thalamus, pons, anterior and posterior cerebellar lobes. During
               IS versus OS condition, there was additional activation in
               parahippocampus, cingulate gyrus, inferior parietal lobule,
               superior temporal, middle and inferior frontal gyrus.
               Conclusion: The findings of the current study support
               involvement of higher cortical and subcortical structures in
               reactive balance control. Greater activation during slipping
               could be attributed to the complexity of the sensorimotor task
               and increased demands to maintain postural stability during
               slipping as compared with regular walking. Furthermore, our
               findings suggest that mental imagery of slipping recruited
               greater neural substrates rather than observation of slipping,
               possibly due to increased sensory, cognitive and perceptual
               processing demands. New and Noteworthy: The behavioral factors
               contributing to falls from external perturbations while walking
               are better understood than neural mechanisms underlying the
               behavioral response. This study examines the neural activation
               pattern associated with reactive balance control during
               slip-like perturbations while walking through an fMRI paradigm.
               This study identified specific neural mechanisms involved in
               complex postural movements during sudden perturbations, to
               particularly determine the role of cortical structures in
               reactive balance control. It further highlights the specific
               differences in neural structures involved in regular unperturbed
               versus perturbed walking.",

               This review provides an overview of this developing area, and
               examines the disease-specific mechanisms underlying walking or
               balance deficits. Medline, PubMed, PsychInfo and Scopus
               databases were searched. Articles that described cortical
               activity during walking and balance tasks in older adults and in
               those with PD were screened by the reviewers. Thirty-seven
               full-text articles were included for review, following an
               initial yield of 566 studies. This review summarizes study
               findings, where increased cortical activity appears to be
               required for older adults and further for participants with PD
               to perform walking and balance tasks, but specific activation
               patterns vary with the demands of the particular task. Studies
               attributed cortical activation to compensatory mechanisms for
               underlying age- or PD-related deficits in automatic movement
               control. However, a lack of standardization within the reviewed
               studies was evident from the wide range of study protocols,
               instruments, regions of interest, outcomes and interpretation of
               outcomes that were reported. Unstandardized data collection,
               processing and reporting limited the clinical relevance and

               walking and balance tasks in older adults and people with PD
               with fNIRS and EEG systems is needed, which will allow direct
               comparison of results and ensure robust data
               collection/reporting. Based on the reviewed articles we provide

               for spinal control of posture. In humans it is now established
               that the cerebral cortex contributes to postural control of
               unperturbed and perturbed standing. The age-related degeneration
               and accompanying functional changes in the brain, reported so
               far mainly in conjunction with simple manual motor tasks, may
               also affect the mechanisms that control complex motor tasks
               involving posture. This review outlines the age-related
               structural and functional changes at spinal and cortical levels
               and provides a mechanistic analysis of how such changes may be
               linked to the behaviorally manifest postural deficits in old
               adults. The emerging picture is that the age-related
               reorganization in motor control during voluntary tasks,
               characterized by differential modulation of spinal reflexes,
               greater cortical activation and cortical disinhibition, is also

               this reorganization underlies the increased coactivation and

               gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, and vastus lateralis muscles.
               Components reflecting shape and timing were defined by the
               magnitude and phase of the cross-correlation function between
               individual stride profiles and the latency corrected ensemble
               average (LCEA) (variability), and between bilateral LCEAs

               level of 0.01 reflecting a Bonferroni adjustment due to multiple
               measures. Parkinsonian gait was significantly different from the
               healthy elderly in several measures: increased shape variability
               and asymmetry in the gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior

               stimulation. Gait parameters shifted toward healthy elderly

               Significant changes were observed in decreased tibialis anterior
               shape variability and asymmetry, and gastrocnemius shape
               variability. Strong trends were also observed in increased

              field of research that is producing increasingly sophisticated
              applications in several spheres of everyday life. Previous
              magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have demonstrated that
              based on the high inter-individual variability of brain structure
              and function, it is possible to identify individuals with high
              accuracy. Otherwise, there is the common belief that
              electroencephalographic (EEG) data recorded at the surface of the
              scalp are too noisy for identification purposes with a comparably
              high hit rate. In the present work, we compared BI quality
              (F1-scores, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity) between
              different types of functional (instantaneous, lagged, and total
              coherence, phase synchronization, correlation, and mutual
              information) and effective (Granger causality, phase
              synchronization, and coherence) connectivity measures. Results
              revealed that across functional connectivity metrics,
              identification accuracy was in the range of 0.98-1, whereas
              sensitivity and F1-scores were between 0.00 and 1 and specificity
              was between 0.99 and 1. BI was higher for the connectivity
              metrics that are contaminated by volume conduction (instantaneous
              connectivity) compared to those that are unaffected by this
              variable (lagged connectivity). Support vector machine and neural
              network algorithms yielded the highest BI, followed by random
              forest and weighted k-nearest neighborhood, whereas linear
              discriminant analysis was less accurate. These results provide
              cross-validated counterevidence to the belief that EEG data are
              too noisy for identification purposes, and demonstrate that
              functional and effective connectivity metrics are particularly
              suited for BI applications with comparable accuracy to MRI. Our

              developmental populations present particular challenges from a
              data processing perspective. These EEGs have a high degree of
              artifact contamination and often short recording lengths. As both
              sample sizes and EEG channel densities increase, traditional
              processing approaches like manual data rejection are becoming
              unsustainable. Moreover, such subjective approaches preclude
              standardized metrics of data quality, despite the heightened
              importance of such measures for EEGs with high rates of initial
              artifact contamination. There is presently a paucity of automated
              resources for processing these EEG data and no consistent
              reporting of data quality measures. To address these challenges,
              we propose the Harvard Automated Processing Pipeline for EEG
              (HAPPE) as a standardized, automated pipeline compatible with EEG
              recordings of variable lengths and artifact contamination levels,
              including high-artifact and short EEG recordings from young
              children or those with neurodevelopmental disorders. HAPPE
              processes event-related and resting-state EEG data from raw files
              through a series of filtering, artifact rejection, and
              re-referencing steps to processed EEG suitable for
              time-frequency-domain analyses. HAPPE also includes a
              post-processing report of data quality metrics to facilitate the
              evaluation and reporting of data quality in a standardized

              and show that HAPPE outperforms seven alternative, widely-used
              processing approaches. HAPPE removes more artifact than all
              alternative approaches while simultaneously preserving greater or
              equivalent amounts of EEG signal in almost all instances. We also

              free and open source Python toolbox designed for hybrid

              state-of-the-art algorithms and includes a rich selection of
              signal processing methods that have been employed by the BCI
              community over the last 20 years. In addition, a wide range of
              classification methods that span from classical machine learning
              algorithms to deep neural network models are provided. Gumpy can
              be used for both EEG and EMG biosignal analysis, visualization,
              real-time streaming and decoding. RESULTS: The usage of the
              toolbox was demonstrated through two different offline example
              studies, namely movement prediction from EEG motor imagery, and
              the decoding of natural grasp movements with the applied finger
              forces from surface EMG (sEMG) signals. Additionally, gumpy was
              used for real-time control of a robot arm using steady-state
              visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) as well as for real-time

              with the gumpy toolbox are comparable or better than previously

              online hybrid BCIs and provides different techniques for
              processing and decoding of EEG and EMG signals. More importantly,

              can match or outperform the state-of-the-art in terms of
              accuracy. This can therefore enable BCI researchers to develop
              more robust decoding algorithms using novel techniques and hence
              chart a route ahead for new BCI improvements.",

  abstract = "PURPOSE: Overuse injuries are common in sport, but complete
              understanding of injury risk factors remains incomplete. Although
              biomechanical studies frequently examine musculoskeletal injury
              mechanisms, human movement variability studies aim to better
              understand neuromotor functioning, with proposed connections
              between overuse injury mechanisms and changes in motor
              variability. METHOD: In a narrative review, we discuss the
              variability-overuse injury hypothesis, which suggests repeated
              load application leads to mechanical tissue breakdown and
              subsequent injury when exceeding the rate of physiological
              adaptation. Due to the multidisciplinary nature of this
              hypothesis, we incorporate concepts from motor control,
              neurophysiology, biomechanics, as well as research design and
              data analysis. We therefore summarize multiple perspectives while
              proposing theoretical relationships between movement variability
              and lower extremity overuse injuries. RESULTS: Experimental data
              are presented and summarized from published experiments examining

              We provide a conceptual framework for sports medicine researchers
              interested in predicting and preventing sports injuries. Under
              performance conditions with greater task demands, we predict
              reduced trial-to-trial movement variability that could increase
              the likelihood of overuse injuries.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) enable direct
              communication with a computer, using neural activity as the
              control signal. This neural signal is generally chosen from a
              variety of well-studied electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. For a
              given BCI paradigm, feature extractors and classifiers are
              tailored to the distinct characteristics of its expected EEG
              control signal, limiting its application to that specific signal.
              Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have been used in
              computer vision and speech recognition to perform automatic
              feature extraction and classification, have successfully been
              applied to EEG-based BCIs; however, they have mainly been applied
              to single BCI paradigms and thus it remains unclear how these
              architectures generalize to other paradigms. Here, we ask if we
              can design a single CNN architecture to accurately classify EEG
              signals from different BCI paradigms, while simultaneously being
              as compact as possible. APPROACH: In this work we introduce
              EEGNet, a compact convolutional neural network for EEG-based
              BCIs. We introduce the use of depthwise and separable
              convolutions to construct an EEG-specific model which
              encapsulates well-known EEG feature extraction concepts for BCI.
              We compare EEGNet, both for within-subject and cross-subject
              classification, to current state-of-the-art approaches across
              four BCI paradigms: P300 visual-evoked potentials, error-related
              negativity responses (ERN), movement-related cortical potentials
              (MRCP), and sensory motor rhythms (SMR). MAIN RESULTS: We show
              that EEGNet generalizes across paradigms better than, and
              achieves comparably high performance to, the reference algorithms
              when only limited training data is available across all tested
              paradigms. In addition, we demonstrate three different approaches
              to visualize the contents of a trained EEGNet model to enable
              interpretation of the learned features. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results
              suggest that EEGNet is robust enough to learn a wide variety of

  abstract = "Measuring brain activity outside the laboratory is of great
              importance for investigating human behavior under naturalistic
              conditions (e.g., in cognition and movement research, application
              of brain-computer interfaces). To measure neuronal activity in
              moving subjects, only modified NIRS and EEG systems are
              applicable. Because conventional EEG systems are too sensitive to
              movement artifacts, artifact sources should be eliminated
              beforehand to improve signal quality. Four different approaches
              for EEG/ERP measures with moving subjects were tested in case
              studies: (i) a purpose-built head-mounted preamplifier, (ii) a
              laboratory system with active electrodes, (iii)+(iv) a wireless
              headset combined with (iii) passive or (iv) active electrodes. A
              standard visual oddball task was applied during rest (without
              movement) and during ergometer rowing. All 14 measures revealed
              very similiar (within subjects) visual evoked potentials for
              rowing and rest. The small intraindividual differences between
              rowing and rest, in comparison to the typically larger
              interindividual differences in the ERP waveforms revealed that
              ERPs can be measured reliably even in an athletic movement like
              rowing. The expected modulation of the motor-related activity by
              force output, on the other hand, was largely affected by movement
              artifacts. Therefore, for a successful application of ERP
              measures in movement research, further developments to
              differentiate between movement-related neuronal activity and
              movement-related artifacts are required. However, it cannot be
              excluded that activities with small magnitudes related to motor
              learning and motor control cannot be detected because they are

              to control the many degrees of freedom of the musculoskeletal
              system in a flexible manner. This problem can be drastically
              simplified if muscle synergies serve as the to-be-controlled
              building blocks of motor performance, instead of the individual
              degrees of freedom. Muscle synergies have been identified as
              coherent activation patterns of a group of muscles in space or
              time, but the neural mechanisms underlying their formation remain
              largely unknown. Here we evaluated the hypothesis that synergies
              are reflected in common input to different contributing muscles,
              and investigated modulations in motor unit (MU) synchronization
              of homologous muscles during a rhythmic balance task. If common
              input is related to muscle synergies, the resultant MU
              synchronization should not be static but task dependent and, in
              the present context, vary in time. Coherence between surface
              electromyographic signals of bilateral leg muscles revealed MU
              synchronization in two distinct frequency bands. MU
              synchronization was not constant but modulated within a movement
              cycle, and its time course resembled the activation patterns of
              the muscles. These results are congruent with a linkage between
              MU synchronization and muscle synergies, and suggest that MU
              synchronization provides an expedient method for studying
              synergy-related neural mechanisms.",

              temporal scales, where each scale affects the other in the
              emergent functions that we appreciate as cognition. As a complex
              adaptive system, the interplay of these scales in the brain
              represents the information that ultimately supports what we think
              and do. The dynamics of these multiscale operations can be
              quantified with measures of complexity, which are sensitive to
              the balance between information that is coded in local cell
              populations and that captured in the network interactions between
              populations. This local vs. global balance has its foundation in
              the structural connectivity of the brain, which is then realized
              through the dynamics of cell populations and their ensuing
              interactions with other populations. Considering brain function
              and cognition in this way enables a different perspective on the
              changes in cognitive function in aging. Our initial work examined
              changes in brain signal complexity from childhood to adulthood.
              Across two independent studies, we observed an overall increase
              in signal complexity with maturation, which also correlated with
              more stable and accurate cognitive performance. There was some
              suggestion that the maximal change occurs in medial posterior
              cortical areas, which have been considered network hubs of the
              brain. In extending to study to healthy aging, we observed a
              scale dependent change in brain complexity across three
              independent studies. Healthy aging brings a shift in local/global
              balance, where more information is coded in local dynamics and
              less in global interactions. This balance is associated with
              better cognitive performance, and interestingly in a more active
              lifestyle. It also seems that the lack of this shift in
              local/global balance is predictive of worse cognitive performance
              and potentially predictive of additional decline indicative of
              dementia.",

              over decades of research and can produce high-quality scientific
              data. It is often assumed that the specific choice of EEG system
              has limited impact on the data and does not add variance to the
              results. However, many low cost and mobile EEG systems are now
              available, and there is some doubt as to the how EEG data vary
              across these newer systems. We sought to determine how variance
              across systems compares to variance across subjects or repeated
              sessions. We tested four EEG systems: two standard research-grade
              systems, one system designed for mobile use with dry electrodes,
              and an affordable mobile system with a lower channel count. We
              recorded four subjects three times with each of the four EEG
              systems. This setup allowed us to assess the influence of all
              three factors on the variance of data. Subjects performed a
              battery of six short standard EEG paradigms based on
              event-related potentials (ERPs) and steady-state visually evoked
              potential (SSVEP). Results demonstrated that subjects account for
              32\% of the variance, systems for 9\% of the variance, and
              repeated sessions for each subject-system combination for 1\% of
              the variance. In most lab-based EEG research, the number of
              subjects per study typically ranges from 10 to 20, and error of
              uncertainty in estimates of the mean (like ERP) will improve by
              the square root of the number of subjects. As a result, the
              variance due to EEG system (9\%) is of the same order of
              magnitude as variance due to subjects (32\%/sqrt(16) = 8\%) with
              a pool of 16 subjects. The two standard research-grade EEG
              systems had no significantly different means from each other
              across all paradigms. However, the two other EEG systems
              demonstrated different mean values from one or both of the two
              standard research-grade EEG systems in at least half of the
              paradigms. In addition to providing specific estimates of the
              variability across EEG systems, subjects, and repeated sessions,
              we also propose a benchmark to evaluate new mobile EEG systems by
              means of ERP responses.",

              combining the EEG2Code method with deep learning, we present an
              extremely powerful approach for decoding visual information from
              EEG. This approach can either be used in a passive BCI setting to
              predict properties of a visual stimulus the person is viewing, or
              it can be used to actively control a BCI spelling application.
              The presented approach was tested in both scenarios and achieved
              an average ITR of 701 bit/min in the passive BCI approach with
              the best subject achieving an online ITR of 1237 bit/min. The
              presented BCI is more than three times faster than the previously
              fastest BCI and allows to discriminate 500,000 different visual
              stimuli based on 2 seconds of EEG data with an accuracy of up to
              100 \%. When using the approach in an asynchronous BCI for

              approaches for brain signal decoding do not translate into better

               of ERP-based BCIs without calibration. APPROACH: We consider two
               approaches for unsupervised classification of ERP signals.
               Learning from label proportions (LLP) was recently shown to be
               guaranteed to converge to a supervised decoder when enough data
               is available. In contrast, the formerly proposed expectation
               maximization (EM) based decoding for ERP-BCI does not have this
               guarantee. However, while this decoder has high variance due to
               random initialization of its parameters, it obtains a higher
               accuracy faster than LLP when the initialization is good. We
               introduce a method to optimally combine these two unsupervised
               decoding methods, letting one method's strengths compensate for
               the weaknesses of the other and vice versa. The new method is
               compared to the aforementioned methods in a resimulation of an
               experiment with a visual speller. MAIN RESULTS: Analysis of the
               experimental results shows that the new method exceeds the
               performance of the previous unsupervised classification
               approaches in terms of ERP classification accuracy and symbol
               selection accuracy during the spelling experiment. Furthermore,
               the method shows less dependency on random initialization of
               model parameters and is consequently more reliable.
               SIGNIFICANCE: Improving the accuracy and subsequent reliability
               of calibrationless BCIs makes these systems more appealing for
               frequent use.",

               training sessions before usage by applying supervised training
               sets to construct the classification model. In this paper, a new
               technique has been introduced for BCI data that requires no
               earlier training. The fundamental rule of this unsupervised
               technique is that the trial with true activation signal inside
               every block must be distinctive from whatever remains of the
               trials inside that block. Consequently, a measure that is
               delicate to this difference can be utilized to settle on a
               choice taking into account a single block with no earlier
               training. In addition, different algorithms of aggregating data
               from many trials have been applied to extend communication speed
               and bit rate. Aggregation strategies include simple average,
               Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Probabilistic Principle

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: In cognitive neuroscience the potential of deep
               neural networks (DNNs) for solving complex classification tasks
               is yet to be fully exploited. The most limiting factor is that
               DNNs as notorious 'black boxes' do not provide insight into
               neurophysiological phenomena underlying a decision. Layer-wise
               relevance propagation (LRP) has been introduced as a novel
               method to explain individual network decisions. NEW METHOD: We
               propose the application of DNNs with LRP for the first time for
               EEG data analysis. Through LRP the single-trial DNN decisions
               are transformed into heatmaps indicating each data point's
               relevance for the outcome of the decision. RESULTS: DNN achieves
               classification accuracies comparable to those of CSP-LDA. In
               subjects with low performance subject-to-subject transfer of
               trained DNNs can improve the results. The single-trial LRP
               heatmaps reveal neurophysiologically plausible patterns,
               resembling CSP-derived scalp maps. Critically, while CSP
               patterns represent class-wise aggregated information, LRP
               heatmaps pinpoint neural patterns to single time points in
               single trials. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): We compare
               the classification performance of DNNs to that of linear CSP-LDA
               on two data sets related to motor-imaginary BCI. CONCLUSION: We
               have demonstrated that DNN is a powerful non-linear tool for EEG
               analysis. With LRP a new quality of high-resolution assessment
               of neural activity can be reached. LRP is a potential remedy for
               the lack of interpretability of DNNs that has limited their
               utility in neuroscientific applications. The extreme specificity
               of the LRP-derived heatmaps opens up new avenues for
               investigating neural activity underlying complex perception or
               decision-related processes.",

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: Signal classification is an important issue in brain
               computer interface (BCI) systems. Deep learning approaches have
               been used successfully in many recent studies to learn features
               and classify different types of data. However, the number of
               studies that employ these approaches on BCI applications is very
               limited. In this study we aim to use deep learning methods to
               improve classification performance of EEG motor imagery signals.
               APPROACH: In this study we investigate convolutional neural
               networks (CNN) and stacked autoencoders (SAE) to classify EEG
               Motor Imagery signals. A new form of input is introduced to
               combine time, frequency and location information extracted from
               EEG signal and it is used in CNN having one 1D convolutional and
               one max-pooling layers. We also proposed a new deep network by
               combining CNN and SAE. In this network, the features that are
               extracted in CNN are classified through the deep network SAE.
               MAIN RESULTS: The classification performance obtained by the
               proposed method on BCI competition IV dataset 2b in terms of
               kappa value is 0.547. Our approach yields 9\% improvement over
               the winner algorithm of the competition. SIGNIFICANCE: Our
               results show that deep learning methods provide better
               classification performance compared to other state of art
               approaches. These methods can be applied successfully to BCI
               systems where the amount of data is large due to daily
               recording.",

               is essential in BCI-based rehabilitation systems to manipulate a
               neural prosthesis or other devices for motor relearning.
               However, due to cortical reorganization, the desynchro-nization
               potential evoked by the motor imagery of patients with brain
               lesions is quite different from that evoked by the motor imagery
               of normal subjects. These differences can be attributed to
               active cortex regions, frequency bands and amplitude. In this

               preserving aspects of data studied in a particular cross-session
               analysis or utilized in a zero-training BCI application. We
               investigated the hypothesis that data alignment methods that

               in more stable, i.e. less variable across recordings, EEG
               features and better BCI classifiers. Exploring different
               families of linear transformations of EEG sensor data, derived
               from statistical measures computed on five minutes of unlabeled

  abstract  = "The decoding of Motor Imagery EEG (MI-EEG) is the most crucial
               part of biosignal processing in the Brain-computer Interface
               (BCI) system. The traditional recognition mode is always devoted
               to extracting and classifying the spatiotemporal feature
               information of MI-EEG in the sensor domain, but these brain
               dynamic characteristics, which are derived from the cerebral
               cortical neurons, are reflected more immediately and obviously
               with high spatial resolution in the source domain. With the
               development of neuroscience, the state-of-the-art EEG Source
               Imaging (ESI) technology converts the scalp signals into brain
               source space and excavates the way for source decoding of
               MI-EEG. Minimum Norm Estimate (MNE) is a classical and original
               EEG inverse transformation. Due to the lack of depth weighting
               of dipoles, it may be more suitable for the estimation of
               superficial dipoles and will be slightly insufficient for
               further source classification. In addition, the selection of a
               Region of Interest (ROI) is usually an essential step in the
               source decoding of MI-EEG by Independent Component Analysis
               (ICA), and the most relevant independent component of original
               EEG signals is transformed into the equivalent current dipoles
               to obtain the ROI by ESI. Although the excellent results of this
               method can be obtained for unilateral limb motor imaging EEG
               signals, which shows more distinct phenomena of event-related
               desynchronization (ERD), the decoding accuracy may be restricted
               for more complex multi-limb motor imagery tasks, whose ERD is no
               longer evident. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel
               brain source estimation to decode MI-EEG by applying Overlapping
               Averaging (OA) in the temporal domain and Weighted Minimum Norm
               Estimate (WMNE), which overcomes the limitations of general
               ROI-based decoding methods and introduces weighting factors to
               complement the estimation of deep dipoles. Its advantages will
               be evaluated on a public dataset with five subjects by comparing
               it with MNE, WMNE, sLORETA, OA-MNE and ICA-WMNE. The proposed
               method reaches a higher average decoding accuracy of 81.32\%
               compared to other methods by 10-fold cross-validation at the
               same chance level. This study will increase the universality of
               the source decoding and facilitate the development of a BCI
               system in the source domain.",

               imagery brain computer interface (MIBCI). Independent component
               analysis (ICA) is a promising spatial filtering technique in BCI
               system for it requires few and unlabeled training samples for
               calibration of the BCI system. However, both the distribution of

               factors of influencing the classification performance of ICA-BCI
               applications. In this study, a new channel selection algorithm
               was proposed for automatically choosing subject-specific minimal
               electrode subsets that can obtain high classification accuracies
               of the ICA-BCI system. The algorithm consisted of two steps:
               selection of ``main electrodes'' located on the motor cortex,
               and subsequent searching of ``subordinate electrodes'', which
               were picked out one by one from the left electrodes until the
               maximum accuracy was achieved. Meanwhile, a
               single\_trial\_based\_self\_testing (STST) method, utilizing one
               single trial to train ICA spatial filters which were only
               applied in the identical trial for extracting motor-related
               independent components (MRICs), was proposed to eliminate the
               influence of bad trials. The channel selection algorithm was
               applied in 72 runs of three-class motor imagery EEG datasets for
               twelve BCI users. Experimental results indicated that the
               classification accuracies using the optimal channels were
               significantly higher than that of standard 8 and 9 channels.
               Meanwhile, ICA algorithm with optimal channel subset had
               comparable performance with Common spatial patterns (CSP)
               algorithm in self-testing and run-to-run cross validation, and
               ICA significantly outperformed CSP in session-to-session and
               subject-to-subject transfer. Although the numbers and locations
               of optimal channels were different between sessions and
               subjects, the main electrodes were basically same between
               different runs for long-term BCI users. Furthermore, the optimal
               electrodes were primarily located on the motor cortex of
               parietal lobe area and the frontal lobe area, few located in the
               occipital lobe area. Too many or too few channels were not
               suitable for ICA calculation, and usually, using 5--8 channels
               of EEG data could achieve better classification performance.
               These findings may offer a reference for the optimization of
               ICA-based BCI systems, and further improve the performance and
               stability of MI-BCI system.",

                 even interact with the outside world in ways that most of us
                 take for granted. In the most severe cases, tetraplegic or
                 post-stroke patients are literally 'locked in' their bodies,
                 unable to exert any motor control after, for example, a spinal
                 cord injury or a brainstem stroke, requiring alternative
                 methods of communication and control. But we suggest that, in
                 the near future, their brains may offer them a way out.
                 Non-invasive electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer
                 interfaces (BCI) can be characterized by the technique used to
                 measure brain activity and by the way that different brain
                 signals are translated into commands that control an effector
                 (e.g., controlling a computer cursor for word processing and
                 accessing the internet). This review focuses on the basic
                 concepts of EEG-based BCI, the main advances in communication,
                 motor control restoration and the downregulation of cortical
                 activity, and the mirror neuron system (MNS) in the context of
                 BCI. The latter appears to be relevant for clinical
                 applications in the coming years, particularly for severely
                 limited patients. Hypothetically, MNS could provide a robust
                 way to map neural activity to behavior, representing the
                 high-level information about goals and intentions of these
                 patients. Non-invasive EEG-based BCIs allow brain-derived
                 communication in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
                 and motor control restoration in patients after spinal cord
                 injury and stroke. Epilepsy and attention deficit and
                 hyperactive disorder patients were able to downregulate their
                 cortical activity. Given the rapid progression of EEG-based
                 BCI research over the last few years and the swift ascent of
                 computer processing speeds and signal analysis techniques, we
                 suggest that emerging ideas (e.g., MNS in the context of BCI)
                 related to clinical neurorehabilitation of severely limited
                 patients will generate viable clinical applications in the

              nonstationarity",
  author   = "Hsu, Sheng-Hsiou and Jung, Tzyy-Ping",
  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: As a human brain performs various cognitive functions
              within ever-changing environments, states of the brain
              characterized by recorded brain activities such as
              electroencephalogram (EEG) are inevitably nonstationary. The
              challenges of analyzing the nonstationary EEG signals include
              finding neurocognitive sources that underlie different brain
              states and using EEG data to quantitatively assess the state
              changes. APPROACH: This study hypothesizes that brain activities
              under different states, e.g. levels of alertness, can be modeled
              as distinct compositions of statistically independent sources
              using independent component analysis (ICA). This study presents a
              framework to quantitatively assess the EEG source nonstationarity
              and estimate levels of alertness. The framework was tested
              against EEG data collected from 10 subjects performing a
              sustained-attention task in a driving simulator. MAIN RESULTS:
              Empirical results illustrate that EEG signals under alert versus
              drowsy states, indexed by reaction speeds to driving challenges,
              can be characterized by distinct ICA models. By quantifying the
              goodness-of-fit of each ICA model to the EEG data using the model
              deviation index (MDI), we found that MDIs were significantly
              correlated with the reaction speeds (r = -0.390 with alertness
              models and r = 0.449 with drowsiness models) and the opposite
              correlations indicated that the two models accounted for sources
              in the alert and drowsy states, respectively. Based on the
              observed source nonstationarity, this study also proposes an
              online framework using a subject-specific ICA model trained with
              an initial (alert) state to track the level of alertness. For
              classification of alert against drowsy states, the proposed
              online framework achieved an averaged area-under-curve of 0.745
              and compared favorably with a classic power-based approach.
              SIGNIFICANCE: This ICA-based framework provides a new way to
              study changes of brain states and can be applied to monitoring
              cognitive or mental states of human operators in
              attention-critical settings or in passive brain-computer
              interfaces.",

  abstract = "Over recent years, brain-computer interface (BCI) has emerged as
              an alternative communication system between the human brain and
              an output device. Deciphered intents, after detecting electrical
              signals from the human scalp, are translated into control
              commands used to operate external devices, computer displays and
              virtual objects in the real-time. BCI provides an augmentative
              communication by creating a muscle-free channel between the brain
              and the output devices, primarily for subjects having neuromotor
              disorders, or trauma to nervous system, notably spinal cord
              injuries (SCI), and subjects with unaffected sensorimotor
              functions but disarticulated or amputated residual limbs. This
              review identifies the potentials of electroencephalography (EEG)
              based BCI applications for locomotion and mobility
              rehabilitation. Patients could benefit from its advancements such
              as wearable lower-limb (LL) exoskeletons, orthosis, prosthesis,
              wheelchairs, and assistive-robot devices. The EEG communication
              signals employed by the aforementioned applications that also
              provide feasibility for future development in the field are
              sensorimotor rhythms (SMR), event-related potentials (ERP) and
              visual evoked potentials (VEP). The review is an effort to
              progress the development of user's mental task related to LL for
              BCI reliability and confidence measures. As a novel contribution,
              the reviewed BCI control paradigms for wearable LL and
              assistive-robots are presented by a general control framework
              fitting in hierarchical layers. It reflects informatic
              interactions, between the user, the BCI operator, the shared
              controller, the robotic device and the environment. Each sub
              layer of the BCI operator is discussed in detail, highlighting
              the feature extraction, classification and execution methods
              employed by the various systems. All applications' key features

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Contamination of scalp measurement by tonic muscle
              artefacts, even in resting positions, is an unavoidable issue in
              EEG recording. These artefacts add significant energy to the
              recorded signals, particularly at high frequencies. To enable
              reliable interpretation of subcortical brain activity, it is
              necessary to detect and discard this contamination. NEW METHOD:
              We introduce a new automatic muscle-removal approach based on the
              traditional Blind Source Separation-Canonical Correlation
              Analysis (BSS-CCA) method and the spectral slope of its
              components. We show that CCA-based muscle-removal methods can
              discriminate between signals with high correlation coefficients
              (brain, mains artefact) and signals with low correlation
              coefficients (white noise, muscle). We also show that typical
              BSS-CCA components are not purely from one source, but are
              mixtures from multiple sources, limiting the performance of
              BSS-CCA in artefact removal. We demonstrate, using our paralysis
              dataset, improved performance using BSS-CCA followed by
              spectral-slope rejection. RESULT: This muscle removal approach
              can reduce high-frequency muscle contamination of EEG, especially
              at peripheral channels, while preserving steady-state brain
              responses in cognitive tasks. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS:
              This approach is automatic and can be applied on any sample of
              data easily. The results show its performance is comparable with
              the ICA method in removing muscle contamination and has
              significantly lower computational complexity. CONCLUSION: We
              identify limitations of the traditional BSS-CCA approach to

              recognition, we used EEG/MEG as well as fMRI to determine the
              latency ranges and spatial areas in which brain activation to
              words is modulated by task demands. We presented letter strings

              in two separate experiments. EEG/MEG sensor statistics revealed
              the earliest reliable task effects at around 150 ms, which were
              localized, using minimum norm estimates (MNE), to left inferior
              temporal, right anterior temporal and left precentral gyri. Later
              task effects (250 and 480 ms) occurred in left middle and

               for measuring neuronal dynamics within well-defined brain
               regions, it is important to quantitatively assess their
               localizing ability. Previous modeling studies and empirical data
               suggest that a combination of MEG and EEG signals should yield
               the most accurate localization, due to their complementary
               sensitivities. However, these two modalities have rarely been
               explicitly combined for source estimation in studies of recorded
               brain activity, and a quantitative empirical assessment of their
               abilities, combined and separate, is currently lacking. Here we
               studied early visual responses to focal Gabor patches flashed
               during subject fixation. MEG and EEG data were collected
               simultaneously and were compared with the functional MRI (fMRI)
               localization produced by identical stimuli in the same subjects.
               This allowed direct evaluation of the localization accuracy of
               separate and combined MEG/EEG inverse solutions. We found that
               the localization accuracy of the combined MEG+EEG solution was
               consistently better than that of either modality alone, using
               three different source estimation approaches. Further analysis
               suggests that this improved localization is due to the different
               properties of the two imaging modalities rather than simply due
               to increased total channel number. Thus, combining MEG and EEG
               data is important for high-resolution spatiotemporal studies of
               the human brain.",

               data streaming for online analysis. A real-time software
               framework is applied, including adaptive artifact rejection,

               classification from connectivity features using a constrained
               logistic regression approach (ProxConn). We evaluate the system

               we evaluate system performance, using ProxConn and a benchmark

               using the dry EEG system. RESULTS: Simulations yielded high
               accuracy (AUC = 0.97 $\pm$ 0.021) for real-time cortical

  abstract = "PURPOSE: Concurrent EEG and fMRI is increasingly used to
              characterize the spatial-temporal dynamics of brain activity.
              However, most studies to date have been limited to conventional
              echo-planar imaging (EPI). There is considerable interest in
              integrating recently developed high-speed fMRI methods with
              high-density EEG to increase temporal resolution and sensitivity
              for task-based and resting state fMRI, and for detecting
              interictal spikes in epilepsy. In the present study using
              concurrent high-density EEG and recently developed high-speed
              fMRI methods, we investigate safety of radiofrequency (RF)
              related heating, the effect of EEG on cortical signal-to-noise
              ratio (SNR) in fMRI, and assess EEG data quality. MATERIALS AND
              METHODS: The study compared EPI, multi-echo EPI, multi-band EPI
              and multi-slab echo-volumar imaging pulse sequences, using
              clinical 3 Tesla MR scanners from two different vendors that were
              equipped with 64- and 256-channel MR-compatible EEG systems,
              respectively, and receive only array head coils. Data were
              collected in 11 healthy controls (3 males, age range 18-70 years)
              and 13 patients with epilepsy (8 males, age range 21-67 years).
              Three of the healthy controls were scanned with the 256-channel
              EEG system, the other subjects were scanned with the 64-channel
              EEG system. Scalp surface temperature, SNR in occipital cortex
              and head movement were measured with and without the EEG cap. The
              degree of artifacts and the ability to identify background
              activity was assessed by visual analysis by a trained expert in
              the 64 channel EEG data (7 healthy controls, 13 patients).
              RESULTS: RF induced heating at the surface of the EEG electrodes
              during a 30-minute scan period with stable temperature prior to
              scanning did not exceed 1.0° C with either EEG system and any of
              the pulse sequences used in this study. There was no significant
              decrease in cortical SNR due to the presence of the EEG cap (p >
              0.05). No significant differences in the visually analyzed EEG
              data quality were found between EEG recorded during high-speed
              fMRI and during conventional EPI (p = 0.78). Residual
              ballistocardiographic artifacts resulted in 58\% of EEG data
              being rated as poor quality. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates
              that high-density EEG can be safely implemented in conjunction
              with high-speed fMRI and that high-speed fMRI does not adversely
              affect EEG data quality. However, the deterioration of the EEG
              quality due to residual ballistocardiographic artifacts remains a
              significant constraint for routine clinical applications of
              concurrent EEG-fMRI.",

              Degeneracies and Its Impact on the Forward Problem in {EEG}",
  author   = "Beltrachini, Leandro",
  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Subtraction-based techniques are known for being
              theoretically rigorous and accurate methods for solving the
              forward problem in electroencephalography (EEG-FP) by means of
              the finite-element method. Within them, the projected subtraction
              (PS) approach is generally adopted because of its computational
              efficiency. Although this technique received the attention of the
              community, its sensitivity to degenerated elements is still
              poorly understood. In this paper, we investigate the impact of
              low-quality tetrahedra on the results computed with the PS
              approach. METHODS: We derived upper bounds on the relative error
              of the element source vector as a function of geometrical
              features describing the tetrahedral discretization of the domain.
              These error bounds were then utilized for showing the instability
              of the PS method with regards to the mesh quality. To overcome
              this issue, we proposed an alternative technique, coined
              projected gradient subtraction (PGS) approach, that exploits the
              stability of the corresponding bounds. RESULTS: Computer
              simulations showed that the PS method is extremely sensitive to
              the mesh shape and size, leading to unacceptable solutions of the
              EEG-FP in case of using suboptimal tessellations. This was not
              the case of the PGS approach, which led to stable and accurate
              results in a comparable amount of time. CONCLUSION: Solutions of
              the EEG-FP computed with the PS method are highly sensitive to
              degenerated elements. Such errors can be mitigated by the PGS
              approach, which showed better performance than the PS technique.
              SIGNIFICANCE: The PGS is an efficient method for computing
              high-quality lead field matrices even in the presence of
              degenerated elements.",

  abstract = "Accuracy in localizing the brain areas that generate
              neuromagnetic activity in magnetoencephalography (MEG) is
              dependent on properly co-registering MEG data to the
              participant's structural magnetic resonance image (MRI).
              Effective MEG-MRI co-registration is, in turn, dependent on how
              accurately we can digitize anatomical landmarks on the surface of
              the head. In this study, we compared the performance of three
              devices-Polhemus electromagnetic system, NextEngine laser scanner
              and Microsoft Kinect for Windows-for source localization accuracy
              and MEG-MRI co-registration. A calibrated phantom was used for
              verifying the source localization accuracy. The Kinect improved
              source localization accuracy over the Polhemus and the laser
              scanner by 2.23 mm (137\%) and 0.81 mm (50\%), respectively.
              MEG-MRI co-registration accuracy was verified on data from five
              healthy human participants, who received the digitization process
              using all three devices. The Kinect device captured approximately
              2000 times more surface points than the Polhemus in one third of
              the time (1 min compared to 3 min) and thrice as many points as
              the NextEngine laser scanner. Following automated surface
              matching, the calculated mean MEG-MRI co-registration error for
              the Kinect was improved by 2.85 mm with respect to the Polhemus
              device, and equivalent to the laser scanner. Importantly, the
              Kinect device automatically aligns 20-30 images per second in
              real-time, reducing the limitations on participant head movement
              during digitization that are implicit in the NextEngine laser
              scan (~1 min). We conclude that the Kinect scanner is an
              effective device for head digitization in MEG, providing the
              necessary accuracy in source localization and MEG-MRI
              co-registration, while reducing digitization time.",

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: A reliable reconstruction of neural activity using
               high-density electroencephalography (EEG) requires an accurate
               spatial localization of EEG electrodes aligned to the structural
               magnetic resonance (MR) image of an individual's head. Current
               technologies for electrode positioning, such as electromagnetic
               digitization, are yet characterized by non-negligible
               localization and co-registration errors. In this study, we
               propose an automated method for spatial localization of EEG
               electrodes using 3D scanning, a non-invasive and easy-to-use
               technology with potential applications in clinical settings.
               Approach. Our method consists of three main steps: 1) the 3D
               scan is ambient light-corrected and spatially aligned to the
               head surface extracted from the anatomical MR image; 2)
               electrode positions are identified by segmenting the 3D scan
               based on predefined colour and topological properties; 3)
               electrode labelling is performed by aligning an EEG montage
               template to the electrode positions. The performance of the
               method was assessed on data collected in eight participants
               wearing high-density EEG caps with 128 sensors, from three
               different manufacturers. We estimated the co-registration error
               using the distance between the MR-based head shape and the
               closest 3D scan points. Also, we quantified the positioning
               error using the distance between the detected electrode
               positions and the corresponding locations manually selected on
               the 3D scan data. Main results. For all participants and EEG
               caps, we obtained a median error of co-registration below 3.0 mm
               and of spatial localization below 1.4 mm. The method based on 3D
               scanning data was significantly more precise compared to the
               electromagnetic digitization technique, and the total time
               required for obtaining electrode positions was reduced by about
               half. Significance. We have introduced a method to automatically
               detect EEG electrodes based on 3D scanning information. We
               believe that our work can contribute to a more effective,

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The present study aims at evaluating and comparing
               electrical and magnetic distributed source imaging methods
               applied to high-density Electroencephalography (hdEEG) and
               Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. We used resolution matrices
               to characterize spatial resolution properties of Minimum Norm
               Estimate (MNE), dynamic Statistical Parametric Mapping (dSPM),
               standardized Low-Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (sLORETA)
               and coherent Maximum Entropy on the Mean (cMEM, an entropy-based
               technique). The resolution matrix provides information of the
               Point Spread Functions (PSF) and of the Crosstalk functions
               (CT), this latter being also called source leakage, as it
               reflects the influence of a source on its neighbors. METHODS:
               The spatial resolution of the inverse operators was first
               evaluated theoretically and then with real data acquired using
               electrical median nerve stimulation on five healthy
               participants. We evaluated the Dipole Localization Error (DLE)
               and the Spatial Dispersion (SD) of each PSF and CT map. RESULTS:
               cMEM showed the smallest spatial spread (SD) for both PSF and CT
               maps, whereas localization errors (DLE) were similar for all
               methods. Whereas cMEM SD values were lower in MEG compared to
               hdEEG, the other methods slightly favored hdEEG over MEG. In
               real data, cMEM provided similar localization error and
               significantly less spatial spread than other methods for both
               MEG and hdEEG. Whereas both MEG and hdEEG provided very accurate
               localizations, all the source imaging methods actually performed
               better in MEG compared to hdEEG according to all evaluation
               metrics, probably due to the higher signal-to-noise ratio of the
               data in MEG. CONCLUSION: Our overall results show that all
               investigated methods provide similar localization errors,
               suggesting very accurate localization for both MEG and hdEEG
               when similar number of sensors are considered for both
               modalities. Intrinsic properties of source imaging methods as
               well as their behavior for well-controlled tasks, suggest an
               overall better performance of cMEM in regards to spatial
               resolution and spatial leakage for both hdEEG and MEG. This
               indicates that cMEM would be a good candidate for studying
               source localization of focal and extended generators as well as
               functional connectivity studies.",

               application of electroencephalography (EEG) is that EEG
               recordings almost always contain artifacts - non-brain signals.
               Among existing automatic artifact-removal methods, artifact
               subspace reconstruction (ASR) is an online and real-time
               capable, component-based method that can effectively remove
               transient or large-amplitude artifacts. However, the
               effectiveness of ASR and the optimal choice of its parameter
               have not been evaluated and reported, especially on real EEG
               data. This study systematically validates ASR on ten EEG

               enough to remove activities from artifacts and eye-related
               components and large enough to retain signals from brain-related
               components. With the appropriate choice of the parameter, ASR

               have large amplitudes (e.g., movement artifacts), or occur

  author   = "Peterson, Steven M and Ferris, Daniel P",
  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Due to its high temporal resolution,
              electroencephalography (EEG) has become a promising tool for
              quantifying cortical dynamics and effective connectivity in a
              mobile setting. While many connectivity estimators are available,
              the efficacy of these measures has not been rigorously validated
              in real-world scenarios. The goal of this study was to quantify
              the accuracy of independent component analysis and multiple
              connectivity measures on ground-truth connections while exposed
              real-world volume conduction and head motion. APPROACH: We
              collected high-density EEG from a phantom head with embedded
              antennae, using neural mass models to generate transiently
              interconnected signals. The head was mounted upon a motion
              platform that mimicked recorded human head motion at various
              walking speeds. We used cross-correlation and signal to noise
              ratio to determine how well independent component analysis
              recovered the original antenna signals. For connectivity
              measures, we computed the average and standard deviation across
              frequency of each estimated connectivity peak. MAIN RESULTS:
              Independent component analysis recovered most antenna signals, as
              evidenced by cross-correlations primarily above 0.8, and
              maintained consistent signal to noise ratio values near 10 dB
              across walking speeds compared to scalp channel data, which had
              decreased signal to noise ratios of ~2 dB at fast walking speeds.
              The connectivity measures used were generally able to identify
              the true interconnections, but some measures were susceptible to
              spurious high-frequency connections inducing large standard
              deviations of ~10 Hz. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results indicate that
              independent component analysis and some connectivity measures can
              be effective at recovering underlying connections among brain
              areas. These results highlight the utility of validating EEG
              processing techniques with a combination of complex signals,
              phantom head use, and realistic head motion.",

              differences in the effects of such deviations on EEG's and MEG's

               of dipole source modelling in epilepsy and other neurological
               applications has not yet been established, mainly because the
               accuracy of the source estimations is still uncertain. The
               registration method proposed in this paper is much more accurate
               than the present-day source estimations, and hence will keep its
               value when improved dipole models are developed.",

              intracerebral potentials occurring simultaneously with scalp EEG
              paroxysms. METHODS: Firstly, scalp EEGs were recorded from 11
              patients. Dipole sources were estimated on averaged spikes and
              projected on 3D-MRIs. Secondly, stereoelectroencephalography
              (SEEG) was recorded from implanted electrodes with direct
              identification onto MRI. Simultaneously with SEEG, control scalp
              electrodes were pasted where spikes peaked during the first
              session. SEEG was averaged, triggered by the main peak of scalp
              spikes. RESULTS: SEEG activity during scalp spikes always
              involved several contacts. In 13 of 14 spikes, maximal fields
              occurred in neocortical regions. In 4 of 5 cases where
              intracerebral activity was simple, spikes could be modeled by one
              source. In all cases where intracerebral activity was complex,
              spikes had to be modeled by several sources. The main dipole
              source was 11 +/- 4.2 mm from the SEEG contact showing the
              maximal intracerebral potential. Early and late dipole
              localization and SEEG fields were concordant in two thirds of
              cases. CONCLUSION: Results indicate that in our group of patients

              never activity limited to mesial structures. Dipole locations and

               well-established approach to localizing the epileptic focus in
               drug-resistant focal epilepsy. So far, ESI has been used
               primarily on interictal events. Emerging evidence suggests that
               ictal ESI is also feasible and potentially useful. We aimed to
               investigate the diagnostic accuracy of ESI on ictal events using
               high-density electroencephalography (EEG). Methods We performed
               ictal ESI on 14 patients (9 with temporal lobe epilepsy)
               admitted for presurgical evaluation who presented seizures
               during a long-term ($\geq$18 h) high-density EEG recording (13
               with 256 electrodes and one with 128 electrodes), and
               subsequently 8 of them underwent epilepsy surgery (postoperative
               follow-up >1 year). Artifact-free EEG epochs at ictal ?nset were
               selected for further analysis. The predominant ictal rhythm was
               identified and filtered ($\pm$1 Hz around the main frequency).
               ESI was computed for each time point using an individual head
               model and a distributed linear inverse solution, and the average
               across source localizations was localized. For validation,
               results were compared with the resection area and postoperative
               outcome. Results Ictal ESI correctly localized the epileptic
               seizure-onset zone in the resection area in five of six
               postoperatively seizure-free patients. Interictal and ictal ESI
               were concordant in 9 of 14 patients and partially concordant in
               additional 4 of 14 patients (93\%). Divergent solutions were
               found in only one of the 14 patients (7\%). Significance Ictal

               produce the scalp-recorded signals. The accuracy of source
               estimates is dependent upon many variables, one of which is the
               accurate description of the scalp positions of the EEG sensors.
               The objective of the present research was to develop a
               photogrammatic method for sensor localization that is fast,
               accurate, and easy to use. Methods With the novel
               photogrammetric method, multiple cameras were arranged in a
               geodesic array, and images of the sensors on the subject's head
               were acquired allowing for the reconstruction of the 3D sensor

              potential distribution generated by cortical sources for a large
              sample of 305 subjects, and solve the inverse problem with AM.
              Statistical comparisons are carried out with the distribution of
              the localization errors. We propose several new AM. These are the
              average of many individual realistic MRI-based models, such as
              surface-based models or lead fields. We demonstrate that the lead
              fields of the AM should be calculated considering source moments
              not constrained to be normal to the cortex. We also show that the
              imperfect anatomical correspondence between all cortices is the
              most important cause of localization errors. Our average models
              perform better than a random individual model or the usual

              models are slightly better than an existing AM with shape guided
              by measured individual electrode positions, and have the
              advantage of not requiring such measurements. Among the studied

              large and systematical clinical and research studies demanding
              EEG source localization, when MRI are unavailable. This AM does
              not need a strict alignment between head models, and can

               activity in the brain based on multichannel surface EEG
               recordings. In contrast to the models presented up to now the
               new method does not assume a limited number of dipolar point
               sources nor a distribution on a given known surface, but
               directly computes a current distribution throughout the full
               brain volume. In order to find a unique solution for the
               3-dimensional distribution among the infinite set of different
               possible solutions, the method assumes that neighboring neurons
               are simultaneously and synchronously activated. The basic
               assumption rests on evidence from single cell recordings in the
               brain that demonstrates strong synchronization of adjacent
               neurons. In view of this physiological consideration the
               computational task is to select the smoothest of all possible
               3-dimensional current distributions, a task that is a common
               procedure in generalized signal processing. The result is a true
               3-dimensional tomography with the characteristic that
               localization is preserved with a certain amount of dispersion,
               i.e., it has a relatively low spatial resolution. The new
               method, which we call Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography
               (LORETA) is illustrated with two different sets of evoked
               potential data, the first showing the tomography of the P100

               new method provides physiologically meaningful results while
               dipolar solutions fail in many situations. In the case of the
               cognitive components, the method offers new hypotheses on the

               have been investigated by computer simulation. The human head is
               represented by a homogeneous spherical conductor including an
               eccentric spherical cavity which approximates effects of actual
               cavities inside the head. The homogeneous sphere model is used
               for assessing the effects caused by neglecting the cavity in the
               volume conductor model in the inverse dipole fitting procedure.
               Four electrode configurations have been examined to investigate
               their relation to the EEG inverse dipole solution. After
               examination of 2520 dipoles in the brain, the effects of
               cavities in the human head are found to be negligible when the
               dipole is located in the cortex or in the subcortex. When the
               dipole is located in the brain stem, the EEG inverse dipole
               solution is strongly affected by the cavity and is sensitive to
               the electrode configuration on the scalp. The EEG inverse dipole
               solution in the deep brain is sensitive to inhomogeneity in the
               lower part of the head when a single positive or negative
               potential pole is observed by the electrodes on the scalp, and
               at the same time is sensitive to the extent of the scalp covered
               by the electrodes. In conclusion, the electrodes should cover as
               much of the upper scalp as possible for deep source

               a spherical head model, for a range of different dipole
               locations and for two different numbers (27 and 148) of
               electrodes. Dipole source localisation is performed by
               iteratively minimising the residual energy (RE), using the
               simplex algorithm. The ratio of the dipole localisation error
               (cm) to the noise level (\%) of Gaussian measurement noise
               amounts to 0.15 cm/\% and 0.047 cm/\% for the 27 and 148

  title     = "Improvements to Simultaneous Electroencephalography --
               functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging and

               Abstract: Both the method of simultaneous electroencephalography
               -- functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) and the
               method of electroencephalographic source localization are
               opening up new understandings in neuroscience, but both are also
               technically very challenging. Simultaneous EEG-fMRI combines the
               strengths of each modality: the temporal resolution of
               electroencephalography (EEG) with the spatial resolution of
               functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). EEG source
               localization provides a non-invasive means of locating in the
               brain the sources of electrical signals measured on the surface
               of the head. The potential for these methods is not limited to
               research neuroscience; each has much to offer in fields like
               clinical neurology and psychiatry. In clinical neurology, for
               example, both methods have been used in the location of
               epileptic foci. Simultaneous EEG-fMRI is technically very
               challenging as each modality serves as a source of artifact and
               safety concerns for the other. Two contaminants prominent in EEG
               acquired in the MRI environment are the gradient artifact (GA)
               and the ballistocardiogram artifact (BCG). The GA occurs only
               during an active MRI acquisition, while the BCG is always
               present, as its origins arise from the cardiovascular system of
               the subject. The current method to remove the GA from the EEG
               recording is called moving windowed average template subtraction
               (MWATS), the windows of which are time-locked to the repetition
               time of the MR acquisition. The problem with MWATS is that there
               are a number of options on how to implement it and little
               consensus or consistency in the field on how it is done. Current
               methods of removing the BCG artifact from the EEG recording all
               rely on establishing its timing based upon a simultaneously
               acquired electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. One issue with using
               the ECG signal is that the differential method for acquiring it
               implemented by the manufactures of the MR compatible EEG systems
               has a high rate of failure. Source localization is technically
               very challenging in part because it relies on multiple
               measurements for its solution. Two of the measurements required
               for accurate source location are the measurement of the EEG
               electrode positions with respect to the underlying anatomy and
               the measurement of the underlying anatomy itself. At present,
               these measurements are made separately: the underlying anatomy
               is measured with an anatomical MRI scan, while the electrode
               positions are measured with either an electromagnetic
               digitization device or a photogrammetry system, neither of which
               is MR compatible. As such the two measurements must be
               registered to one another, typically through the location of
               fiducial markers on the surface of the head in both of the
               measurements. By aligning the markers, the two measurements can
               be brought into register. The issues with this technique are two
               fold. First, aligning the separate measurements introduces a
               potential source of error. Second, both of the current methods
               for measuring the electrode positions are very time consuming.
               This thesis focuses in robust solutions to these issues.
               Specifically what follows is: 1) an analysis of the consequences
               of all the principal options for implementing the moving
               windowed average template subtraction; 2) a method to eliminate
               the need of the separately recorded ECG signal for establishing
               the timing of the BCG artifact; and 3) a method for
               automatically locating and identifying EEG electrodes in an
               anatomical MRI scan. The analysis of the MWATS method permits
               more informed decisions to be made in its implementation. The
               method to eliminate the need for the ECG signal is to both
               simplify the experimental setup and to make the EEG-fMRI
               recording more robust. Automatically locating and identifying
               EEG electrodes in an anatomical MRI scan eliminates both a
               measurement step and a registration step. The elimination of the
               registration step eliminates a potential source of error. In
               addition, the combination of the elimination of the measurement
               step and the automatic way in which the algorithm progresses
               greatly reduces the time required for this process.",

               in dipole solutions between individual and group-average data
               sets using a standard realistic head model. METHODS: Auditory
               evoked potentials were recorded from 14 right-handed healthy
               subjects using a 64 electrode montage. Inverse dipole solutions
               were obtained for each individual data set, as well as for all

               Differences in dipole solutions between individual and
               grand-average responses are reported. Simulations using a two
               dipole model with 15 different electrode sets are then used to
               investigate the effects of electrode misplacement and random
               noise on dipole localization. These effects are compared to
               those due to grand-averaging. RESULTS: The average differences
               in dipole locations between the individual and grand-averaged
               data sets were approximately 1.1 cm (SD=0.7 cm). This difference

               localization and the number of scalp EEG recording channels.
               METHODS: 128 EEG channel recordings of 5 pediatric patients with
               medically intractable partial epilepsy were used to perform
               source localization of interictal spikes. The results were
               compared with surgical resection and intracranial recordings.
               Various electrode configurations were tested and a series of
               computer simulations based on a realistic head boundary element
               model were also performed in order to further validate the
               clinical findings. RESULTS: The improvement seen in source
               localization substantially decreases as the number of electrodes
               increases. This finding was evaluated using the surgical
               resection, intracranial recordings and computer simulation. It
               was also shown in the simulation that increasing the electrode
               numbers could remedy the localization error of deep sources. A
               plateauing effect was seen in deep and superficial sources with
               further increasing the electrode number. CONCLUSION: The source
               localization is improved when electrode numbers increase, but
               the absolute improvement in accuracy decreases with increasing
               electrode number. SIGNIFICANCE: Increasing the electrode number
               helps decrease localization error and thus can more ably assist
               the physician to better plan for surgical procedures.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The electroencephalogram (EEG) reflects the
               electrical activity in the brain on the surface of scalp. A
               major challenge in this field is the localization of sources in
               the brain responsible for eliciting the EEG signal measured at
               the scalp. In order to estimate the location of these sources,
               one must correctly model the sources, i.e., dipoles, as well as
               the volume conductor in which the resulting currents flow. In
               this study, we investigate the effects of dipole depth and
               orientation on source localization with varying sets of
               simulated random noise in 4 realistic head models. METHODS:
               Dipole simulations were performed using realistic head models
               and using the boundary element method (BEM). In all, 92 dipole
               locations placed in temporal and parietal regions of the head
               with varying depth and orientation were investigated along with
               6 different levels of simulated random noise. Localization
               errors due to dipole depth, orientation and noise were
               investigated. RESULTS: The results indicate that there are no
               significant differences in localization error due tangential and
               radial dipoles. With high levels of simulated Gaussian noise,
               localization errors are depth-dependent. For low levels of added
               noise, errors are similar for both deep and superficial sources.
               CONCLUSION: It was found that if the signal-to-noise ratio is
               above a certain threshold, localization errors in realistic head
               models are, on average the same for deep and superficial
               sources. As the noise increases, localization errors increase,
               particularly for deep sources.",

  abstract  = "EEG involves the recording, analysis, and interpretation of
               voltages recorded on the human scalp which originate from brain
               gray matter. EEG is one of the most popular methods of studying
               and understanding the processes that underlie behavior. This is
               so, because EEG is relatively cheap, easy to wear, light weight
               and has high temporal resolution. In terms of behavior, this
               encompasses actions, such as movements that are performed in
               response to the environment. However, there are methodological
               difficulties which can occur when recording EEG during movement
               such as movement artifacts. Thus, most studies about the human
               brain have examined activations during static conditions. This
               article attempts to compile and describe relevant methodological
               solutions that emerged in order to measure body and brain
               dynamics during motion. These descriptions cover suggestions on

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The estimation of cortical current activity from
              scalp-recorded potentials is a complicated mathematical problem
              that requires fairly precise knowledge of the location of the
              scalp electrodes. It is expected that spatial mislocalization of
              electrodes will introduce errors in this estimation. The present
              study uses simulated and real data to quantify these errors for
              dipole current sources in a spherical head model. METHODS: A
              3-dimensional digitizer was used to locate the positions of 31
              scalp electrodes placed on the head according to the 10-20 system
              in 10 normal subjects. Dipole localizations were performed on
              auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) collected from these subjects.
              RESULTS: Computer simulations with several dipole source
              configurations suggest that errors in locations and orientations
              on the order of 5 mm and 5 degrees, respectively, are possible
              for electrode mislocalizations of about 5 degrees. In actual
              experimental settings, digitized electrode positions were
              typically mislocalized by an average of about 4 degrees from
              their standard 10-20 positions on a spherical model. These
              differences in electrode positions translated to mean differences
              of about 8 mm in dipole locations and 5 degrees in dipole
              orientations. CONCLUSIONS: Dipole estimation errors due to
              electrode mislocalizations are within the limits of errors due to

              present study, the TD system and its 3-D database of labels for
              the 1988 Talairach atlas were tested for labeling of functional
              activation foci. TD system labels were compared with
              author-designated labels of activation coordinates from over 250
              published functional brain-mapping studies and with manual
              atlas-derived labels from an expert group using a subset of these
              activation coordinates. Automated labeling by the TD system
              compared well with authors' labels, with a 70\% or greater label

              to greater than 90\% within a search range of +/-5 mm for most
              sites. An adaptive grey matter (GM) range-search utility was

               effective data driven method for analyzing EEG data, separating
               signals from temporally and functionally independent brain and
               non-brain source processes and thereby increasing their
               definition. Dimension reduction by Principal Component Analysis
               (PCA) has often been recommended before ICA decomposition of EEG
               data, both to minimize the amount of required data and
               computation time. Here we compared ICA decompositions of
               fourteen 72-channel single subject EEG data sets obtained (i)
               after applying preliminary dimension reduction by PCA, (ii)
               after applying no such dimension reduction, or else (iii)
               applying PCA only. Reducing the data rank by PCA (even to remove
               only 1\% of data variance) adversely affected both the numbers
               of dipolar independent components (ICs) and their stability
               under repeated decomposition. For example, decomposing a
               principal subspace retaining 95\% of original data variance
               reduced the mean number of recovered 'dipolar' ICs from 30 to 10
               per data set and reduced median IC stability from 90\% to 76\%.
               PCA rank reduction also decreased the numbers of near-equivalent
               ICs across subjects. For instance, decomposing a principal
               subspace retaining 95\% of data variance reduced the number of
               subjects represented in an IC cluster accounting for frontal
               midline theta activity from 11 to 5. PCA rank reduction also
               increased uncertainty in the equivalent dipole positions and
               spectra of the IC brain effective sources. These results suggest
               that when applying ICA decomposition to EEG data, PCA rank
               reduction should best be avoided.",

               a new imaging modality to study how cognitive processes support
               locomotion. Electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG),
               due to their time resolution, non-invasiveness and portability
               are the techniques of choice for MoBI, but synchronization
               requirements among others restrict its use to high-end research
               facilities. Here we test the effectiveness of a technique that
               enables us to achieve MoBI-grade synchronization of EEG and EMG,
               even when other strategies (such as Lab Streaming Layer (LSL))
               cannot be used e.g., due to the unavailability of proprietary
               Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which is often the
               case in clinical settings. The proposed strategy is that of
               aligning several spikes at the beginning and end of the session.
               We delivered a train of spikes to the EEG amplifier and EMG
               electrodes every 2 s over a 10-min time period. We selected a
               variable number of spikes (from 1 to 10) both at the beginning
               and end of the time series and linearly resampled the data so as
               to align them. We then compared the misalignment of the
               ``middle'' spikes over the whole recording to test for jitter
               and synchronization drifts, highlighting possible nonlinearities
               (due to hardware filters) and estimated the maximum length of
               the recording to achieve a [-5 to 5] ms misalignment range. We
               demonstrate that MoBI-grade synchronization can be achieved
               within 10-min recordings with a 1.7 ms jitter and [-5 5] ms
               misalignment range. We show that repeated spike delivery can be
               used to test online synchronization options and to troubleshoot
               synchronization issues over EEG and EMG. We also show that
               synchronization cannot rely only on the equipment sampling rate
               advertised by manufacturers. The synchronization strategy
               described can be used virtually in every clinical environment,
               and may increase the interest among a broader spectrum of
               clinicians and researchers in the MoBI framework, ultimately
               leading to a better understanding of the brain processes
               underlying locomotion control and the development of more

              multi-session electroencephalographic (EEG) data is how to

              subjects and/or sessions, each associated with its own set of
              source processes and scalp projections. Here we introduce a novel
              statistical method for characterizing the spatial consistency of
              EEG dynamics across a set of data records. Measure Projection
              Analysis (MPA) first finds voxels in a common template brain
              space at which a given dynamic measure is consistent across
              nearby source locations, then computes local-mean EEG measure
              values for this voxel subspace using a statistical model of
              source localization error and between-subject anatomical
              variation. Finally, clustering the mean measure voxel values in
              this locally consistent brain subspace finds brain spatial
              domains exhibiting distinguishable measure features and provides
              3-D maps plus statistical significance estimates for each EEG
              measure of interest. Applied to sufficient high-quality data, the
              scalp projections of many maximally independent component (IC)
              processes contributing to recorded high-density EEG data closely
              match the projection of a single equivalent dipole located in or
              near brain cortex. We demonstrate the application of MPA to a
              multi-subject EEG study decomposed using independent component
              analysis (ICA), compare the results to k-means IC clustering in
              EEGLAB (sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab), and use surrogate data to test MPA
              robustness. A Measure Projection Toolbox (MPT) plug-in for EEGLAB
              is available for download (sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/MPT). Together, MPA
              and ICA allow use of EEG as a 3-D cortical imaging modality with

              and trained on the protocol for that structure. Each rater pair
              was tested for concordance on 6 of the 40 brains; once they had
              achieved reliability standards, they divided the task of
              delineating the remaining 34 brains. The data were then spatially
              normalized to well-known templates using 3 popular algorithms:
              AIR5.2.5's nonlinear warp (Woods et al., 1998) paired with the
              ICBM452 Warp 5 atlas (Rex et al., 2003), FSL's FLIRT (Smith et
              al., 2004) was paired with its own template, a skull-stripped
              version of the ICBM152 T1 average; and SPM5's unified
              segmentation method (Ashburner and Friston, 2005) was paired with
              its canonical brain, the whole head ICBM152 T1 average. We thus
              produced 3 variants of our atlas, where each was constructed from
              40 representative samples of a data processing stream that one
              might use for analysis. For each normalization algorithm, the
              individual structure delineations were then resampled according
              to the computed transformations. We next computed averages at
              each voxel location to estimate the probability of that voxel
              belonging to each of the 56 structures. Each version of the atlas
              contains, for every voxel, probability densities for each region,
              thus providing a resource for automated probabilistic labeling of
              external data types registered into standard spaces; we also
              computed average intensity images and tissue density maps based

               SII generators were identified by well-defined scalp potentials
               and source localisation from high-density 128-channel EEG.
               Earliest responses (~20 ms) from area 3b in the depth of the
               post-central gyrus did not show significant adaptation to
               stimuli repeated at 300 ms intervals. In contrast, responses
               around 45 ms from the crown of the gyrus (areas 1 and 2) rapidly
               lessened to a plateau and abated at the 20th stimulation, and
               activities from SII in the parietal operculum at ~100 ms

               This may index the passage from an early form of sensory storage

               slow wave sleep are one of the most consistent biological
               markers of depression, it is plausible that the antidepressant

               multi-night, cross-over design study, participants with major
               depression (non-medicated; n = 17) underwent baseline, SWD, and
               recovery sleep sessions, and were recorded with high-density EEG
               (hdEEG). During SWD, acoustic stimuli were played to suppress
               subsequent slow waves, without waking up the participant. The
               effects of SWD on depressive symptoms were assessed with both

               subjects (4 males). INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND
               RESULTS: Initially, propofol induced increases in EEG power from
               12-25 Hz. Loss of consciousness (LOC) was accompanied by the
               appearance of EEG slow waves that resembled the slow waves of
               NREM sleep. We compared slow waves in propofol to slow waves
               recorded during natural sleep and found that both populations of
               waves share similar cortical origins and preferentially
               propagate along the mesial components of the default network.
               However, propofol slow waves were spatially blurred compared to
               sleep slow waves and failed to effectively entrain spindle
               activity. Propofol also caused an increase in gamma (25-40 Hz)
               power that persisted throughout LOC. Source modeling analysis
               showed that this increase in gamma power originated from the
               anterior and posterior cingulate cortices. During LOC, we found
               increased gamma functional connectivity between these regions
               compared to the wakefulness. CONCLUSIONS: Propofol anesthesia is
               a sleep-like state and slow waves are associated with diminished

              split-belt exposure or alternating four times between split-belt
              and tied-belt conditions rapidly in succession. Both of these
              single-day training groups were tested again on day 5.
              Experiencing four abbreviated exposures on day 1 improved the
              performance on day 5 compared with one extended exposure on day
              1. Moreover, this abbreviated group performed similarly to the
              group that trained for 4 consecutive days before testing on day
              5, despite only having one-quarter of the total training time.
              These results demonstrate that we can leverage training structure
              to achieve a high degree of performance while minimizing training
              sessions. NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Learning a new movement requires
              repetition. Here, we demonstrate how to more efficiently train an
              adapted walking pattern. By compressing split-belt treadmill
              training delivered over 4 days to four abbreviated bouts of
              training delivered on the first day of training, we were able to
              induce equivalent savings over a 5-day span. These results
              suggest that we can manipulate the delivery of training to most
              efficiently drive multiday learning of a novel walking pattern.",

              Using new methods to normalise walking speed and perturbation

              demonstrates humans' remarkable ability to retain learned
              movements amid changing environments. This is important within
              the context of locomotion, as the ability of the nervous system
              to ``remember'' how to walk in specific environments enables us
              to navigate changing terrains and progressively improve gait
              patterns with rehabilitation. Here, we used a split-belt
              treadmill to study precisely how people save newly learned
              walking patterns. In Experiment 1, we investigated savings by
              systematically varying the learning and unlearning environments.
              Savings was predominantly influenced by 1) previous exposure to
              similar abrupt changes in the environment and 2) the amount of
              exposure to the new environment. Relearning was fastest when
              these two factors coincided, and we did not observe savings after
              the environment was introduced gradually during initial learning.
              In Experiment 2, we then studied whether people store explicit
              information about different walking environments that mirrors
              savings of a new walking pattern. Like savings, we found that
              previous exposure to abrupt changes in the environment also drove
              the ability to recall a previously experienced walking
              environment accurately. Crucially, the information recalled was
              extrinsic information about the learning environment (i.e.,
              treadmill speeds) and not intrinsic information about the walking
              pattern itself. We conclude that simply learning a new walking
              pattern is not enough for long-term savings; rather, savings of a
              learned walking pattern involves recall of the environment or
              extended training at the learned state.",

               baseline gait asymmetries affected how patients adapt and store
               new walking patterns. METHODS: Subjects with stroke and
               age-matched controls were studied walking at a 2:1 speed ratio
               on the split-belt during adaptation and assessed for retention
               of the learned pattern (the after-effect) with both belts at the

  abstract  = "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Understanding the behavioral mechanisms of
               sensorimotor adaptation and learning is essential for designing
               rational rehabilitation interventions. RECENT FINDINGS:
               Adaptation is the trial-and-error process of adjusting movement
               to new demands and is now thought to be more than a simple error
               cancellation process. Instead, it may calibrate the brain's
               prediction of how the body will move and takes into account
               costs associated with the new task demand. Damage of the
               cerebellum systematically disrupts adaptation, but damage to
               other brain regions often does not. Adapting to perturbations
               driven by a device like a robot or a treadmill leads to only
               partial generalization to unconstrained 'real-world' movements.
               Repeated adaptation can lead to learning a new motor
               calibration, but process of consolidation of this type of
               learning is less understood in patients. SUMMARY: Adaptation is
               inherently important for rehabilitation by making movement
               flexible, but can also be used to ascertain whether some
               patients can generate a more normal motor pattern. Repeated
               adaptation can lead to learning of a new, more permanent motor
               calibration. Though less understood, this type of learning is
               likely to be an important method for making long-term
               improvements in patients' movement patterns.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Even after rehabilitation, many
               individuals with strokes have residual gait deviations and
               limitations in functional walking. Applying the principles of
               motor adaptation through a split-belt treadmill walking paradigm
               can lead to short-term improvements in step length asymmetry
               after stroke. The focus of this case study was to determine
               whether it is possible to capitalize on these improvements for
               long-term gain. CASE DESCRIPTION: The participant was a
               36-year-old woman who was 1.6 years poststroke. She had a slow
               walking speed and multiple specific gait deviations, including
               step length asymmetry. INTERVENTION: The participant walked on a
               split-belt treadmill 3 d/wk for 4 weeks, with the paretic leg on
               the slower of the two treadmill belts. The goal was 30 minutes
               of split-belt treadmill walking each day, followed by overground
               walking practice to reinforce improvements in step length
               symmetry. OUTCOMES: With training, step length asymmetry
               decreased from 21\% to 9\% and decreased further to 7\%
               asymmetry 1 month after training. Self-selected walking speed
               increased from 0.71 m/s to 0.81 m/s after training and 0.86 m/s
               1 month later. Percent recovery, measured by the Stroke Impact
               Scale (SIS), increased from 40\% to 50\% posttraining and to
               60\% 1 month later. DISCUSSION: Improvements in step length
               symmetry were observed following training and these improvements
               were maintained 1 month later. Concomitant changes in clinical
               measures were also observed, although these improvements were
               modest. The outcomes for this participant are encouraging given
               the relatively small dose of training. They suggest that after
               stroke, short-term adaptation can be capitalized on through
               repetitive practice and can lead to longer-term improvements
               stroke.",

               changes in gait deficits after stroke. The purpose of this study
               was to determine whether longer-term improvements in step length
               asymmetry could be achieved with repeated split-belt treadmill
               walking practice using an error augmentation strategy. METHODS:
               13 persons with chronic stroke (>6 months) participated in
               testing: (1) prior to 12 sessions of split-belt treadmill
               training, (2) after the training, and (3) in follow-up testing
               at 1 and 3 months. Step length asymmetry was the target of
               training, so belt speeds were set to augment step length
               asymmetry such that aftereffects resulted in reduced step length
               asymmetry during overground walking practice. Each individual
               was classified as a ``responder'' or ``nonresponder'' based on
               whether their reduction in step length asymmetry exceeded
               day-to-day variability. RESULTS: For the group and for the
               responders (7 individuals), step length asymmetry improved from
               baseline to posttesting (P < .05) through an increased step
               length on both legs but a relatively larger change on the
               shorter step side (P < .05). Other parameters that were not
               targeted (e.g., stance time asymmetry) did not change over the
               intervention. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that
               short-term adaptations can be capitalized on through repetitive
               practice and can lead to longer-term improvements in gait
               deficits poststroke. The error augmentation strategy, which
               promotes stride-by-stride adjustment to reduce asymmetry and
               results in improved asymmetry during overground walking
               practice, appears to be critical for obtaining the improvements
               observed.",

               adaptive effects observed on a treadmill transfer to walking

               split-belt treadmill adaptation transfer to overground walking
               in healthy persons and those poststroke. METHODS: Eleven
               poststroke and 11 age-matched and gender-matched healthy
               subjects walked over ground before and after walking on a
               split-belt treadmill. Adaptation and aftereffects in step length
               and double support time were calculated. RESULTS: Both groups
               demonstrated partial transfer of the aftereffects observed on
               the treadmill (P<.001) to overground walking (P<.05), but the
               transfer was more robust in the subjects poststroke (P<.05). The
               subjects with baseline asymmetry after stroke improved in
               asymmetry of step length and double limb support (P=.06).
               CONCLUSIONS: The partial transfer of aftereffects to overground
               walking suggests that some shared neural circuits that control
               locomotion for different environmental contexts are adapted
               during split-belt treadmill walking. The larger adaptation
               transfer from the treadmill to overground walking in the stroke
               survivors may be due to difficulty adjusting their walking
               pattern to changing environmental demands. Such difficulties
               with context switching have been considered detrimental to
               function poststroke. However, we propose that the persistence of
               improved symmetry when changing context to overground walking
               could be used to advantage in poststroke rehabilitation.",

  abstract  = "Human locomotion must be flexible in order to meet varied
               environmental demands. Alterations to the gait pattern occur on
               different time scales, ranging from fast, reactive adjustments
               to slower, more persistent adaptations. A recent study in humans
               demonstrated that the cerebellum plays a key role in slower
               walking adaptations in interlimb coordination during split-belt
               treadmill walking, but not fast reactive changes. It is not
               known whether cerebral structures are also important in these
               processes, though some studies of cats have suggested that they
               are not. We used a split-belt treadmill walking task to test
               whether cerebral damage from stroke impairs either type of
               flexibility. Thirteen individuals who had sustained a single
               stroke more than 6 months prior to the study (four females) and
               13 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects were

               stroke involving cerebral structures did not impair either
               reactive or adaptive abilities and did not disrupt storage of
               new interlimb relationships (i.e. after-effects). This suggests
               that cerebellar interactions with brainstem, rather than
               cerebral structures, comprise the critical circuit for this type
               of interlimb control. Furthermore, the after-effects from a

               gait parameters. In order to re-establish symmetric walking, the
               choice of which leg is on the fast belt during split-belt
               walking must be based on the subject's initial asymmetry. These
               findings demonstrate that cerebral stroke survivors are indeed
               able to adapt interlimb coordination. This raises the
               possibility that asymmetric walking patterns post-stroke could
               be remediated utilizing the split-belt treadmill as a long-term
               rehabilitation strategy.",

               the effect of split-belt treadmill based perturbations on

               for dynamic stability and symmetry during unperturbed and

               unperturbed and perturbed walking conditions on a split-belt
               treadmill. The continuous perturbation involved moving the
               parallel belts at unequal speeds (1.5 m/s: 0.5 m/s). Margins of
               stability (MoS) and step length symmetry (SYM) were assessed.
               RESULTS: Stability and symmetry measures each decreased at the
               onset of the split walking perturbation. Only anterior-posterior
               (AP) MoS and SYM exhibited adaptive changes. Associations were
               found primarily for AP MoS with immediate changes in SYM at the
               onset of split walking, and over the duration of the split

               with a continuous perturbation. Additionally, dynamic stability
               was associated with symmetry during perturbed walking.",

               that the gradual presentation of small perturbations (errors)
               during learning results in better transfer of a newly learned
               walking pattern to overground walking. Whether the same result
               would be true after stroke is not known. OBJECTIVE: To determine
               whether introducing gradual perturbations, during locomotor
               learning using a split-belt treadmill influences learning the
               novel walking pattern or transfer to overground walking
               poststroke. METHODS: Twenty-six chronic stroke survivors
               participated and completed the following walking testing
               paradigm: baseline overground walking; baseline treadmill
               walking; split-belt treadmill/adaptation period (belts moving at
               different speeds); catch trial (belts at same speed); post
               overground walking. Subjects were randomly assigned to the
               Gradual group (gradual changes in treadmill belts speed during
               adaptation) or the Abrupt group (a single, large, abrupt change
               during adaptation). Step length asymmetry adaptation response on
               the treadmill and transfer of learning to overground walking was
               assessed. RESULTS: Step length asymmetry during the catch trial
               was the same between groups ( P = .195) confirming that both
               groups learned a similar amount. The magnitude of transfer to
               overground walking was greater in the Gradual than in the Abrupt
               group ( P = .041). CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of gradual
               perturbations (small errors), compared with abrupt (larger
               errors), during a locomotor adaptation task seems to improve
               transfer of the newly learned walking pattern to overground
               walking poststroke. However, given the limited magnitude of
               transfer, future studies should examine other factors that could
               impact locomotor learning and transfer poststroke.",

               adapt and improve step length symmetry in the context of
               split-belt treadmill (SBT) walking. However, less knowledge
               exists about the strategies involved for such adaptations. This
               study analyzed lower limb muscle activity in individuals
               post-stroke related to SBT-induced changes in step length.
               METHODS: Step length and surface EMG activity of six lower limb
               muscles were evaluated in individuals post-stroke (n=16) during
               (adaptation) and after (after-effects) walking at unequal belt
               speeds. RESULTS: During adaptation, significant increases in EMG
               activity were mainly found in proximal muscles (p⩽0.023),
               whereas after-effects were observed particularly in the distal
               muscles. The plantarflexor EMG increased after walking on the

              The aim of this study was to examine changes in spatiotemporal
              gait and stability parameters in response to sudden mechanical
              perturbations in medio-lateral (ML) and anterior-posterior (AP)

              postural recovery responses. Ten healthy adults (mean = 26.4, SD
              = 4.1 years) walked on a treadmill that provided unexpected
              discrete ML and AP surface horizontal perturbations. Participants
              walked under no perturbation (normal walking), and under left,
              right, forward, and backward sudden mechanical perturbation
              conditions. Gait parameters were computed including stride length
              (SL), step width (SW), and cadence, as well as dynamic stability
              in AP- (MoS-AP) and ML- (MoS-ML) directions. Gait and stability
              parameters were quantified by means, variability, and extreme
              values. Overall, participants walked with a shorter stride
              length, a wider step width, and a higher cadence during perturbed
              walking, but despite this, the effect of perturbations on means
              of SW and MoS-ML was not statistically significant. These effects
              were found to be significantly greater when the perturbations
              were applied toward the ML-direction. Variabilities, as well as
              extremes of gait-related parameters, showed strong responses to
              the perturbations. The higher variability as a response to
              perturbations might be an indicator of instability and fall risk,
              on the same note, an adaptation strategy and beneficial to
              recover balance. Parameters identified in this study may
              represent useful indicators of locomotor adaptation to
              successfully compensate sudden mechanical perturbation during
              walking. The potential association of the extracted parameters
              with fall risk needs to be determined in fall-prone populations.",

              and attended 9 training sessions over 3 weeks using a split-belt
              treadmill. For PT, perturbations were produced by changing the
              speed of one of the belts during stance phase every 8 to 16
              steps. The intensity of the perturbations increased progressively

              duration of the training sessions in nPT, i.e. without

  abstract = "Introduction: People with stroke often have impaired stepping
              responses following balance perturbations, which increases their
              risk of falling. Computer-controlled movable platforms are
              promising tools for delivering perturbation-based balance
              training under safe and standardized circumstances. Purpose: This
              proof-of-concept study aimed to identify whether a 5-week
              perturbation-based balance training program on a movable platform
              improves reactive step quality in people with chronic stroke.
              Materials and Methods: Twenty people with chronic stroke received
              a 5-week perturbation-based balance training (10 sessions, 45
              min) on a movable platform. As the primary outcome, backward, and
              forward reactive step quality (i.e., leg angle at stepping-foot
              contact) was assessed with a lean-and-release (i.e., non-trained)
              task at pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention, and 6
              weeks after intervention (follow-up). Additionally, reactive step
              quality was assessed on the movable platform in multiple
              directions, as well as, the percentage side steps upon sideward
              perturbations. To ensure that changes in the primary outcome
              could not solely be attributed to learning effects on the task
              due to repeated testing, 10 randomly selected participants
              received an additional pre-intervention assessment, 6 weeks prior
              to training. Clinical assesments included the 6-item
              Activity-specific Balance Confidence (6-ABC) scale, Berg Balance
              Scale (BBS), Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS), 10-Meter Walking Test
              (10-MWT), and Timed Up and Go-test (TUG). Results: After
              lean-and-release, we observed 4.3° and 2.8° greater leg angles at
              post compared to pre-intervention in the backward and forward
              direction, respectively. Leg angles also significantly improved
              in all perturbation directions on the movable platform. In
              addition, participants took 39\% more paretic and 46\% more
              non-paretic side steps. These effects were retained at follow-up.
              Post-intervention, BBS and TIS scores had improved. At follow-up,
              TIS and 6-ABC scores had significantly improved compared to
              pre-intervention. No significant changes were observed between
              the two pre-intervention assessments (n=10). Conclusion: A 5-week
              perturbation-based balance training on a movable platform appears
              to improve reactive step quality in people with chronic stroke.
              Importantly, improvements were retained after 6 weeks. Further

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Older adults are at an exceptionally high risk of
               falls, and most falls occur during locomotor activities such as
               walking. Reduced local dynamic stability in old age is often
               interpreted to suggest a lessened capacity to respond to more
               significant balance challenges encountered during walking and
               future falls risk. However, it remains unclear whether local
               dynamic stability during normal, unperturbed walking predicts
               the response to larger external balance disturbances. RESEARCH
               QUESTION: We tested the hypothesis that larger values of local
               dynamic instability during unperturbed walking would positively
               correlate with larger changes thereof due to optical flow
               balance perturbations. METHODS: We used trunk kinematics
               collected in subjects across a spectrum of walking balance
               integrity - young adults, older non-fallers, and older fallers -
               during walking with and without mediolateral optical flow
               perturbations of four different amplitudes. RESULTS: We first
               found evidence that optical flow perturbations of sufficient
               amplitude appear capable of revealing independent effects of
               aging and falls history that are not otherwise apparent during
               normal, unperturbed walking. We also reject our primary
               hypothesis; a significant negative correlation only in young
               adults indicated that individuals with more local dynamic
               instability during normal, unperturbed walking exhibited smaller
               responses to optical flow perturbations. In contrast, most
               prominently in older fallers, the response to optical flow
               perturbations appeared independent of their baseline level of
               dynamic instability. SIGNIFICANCE: We propose that predicting
               the response to balance perturbations in older fallers, at least
               that measured using local dynamic stability, likely requires
               measuring that response directly.",

  author   = "Huang, Helen J and Ferris, Daniel P",
  abstract = "During gait rehabilitation, therapists or robotic devices often
              supply physical assistance to a patient's lower limbs to aid
              stepping. The expensive equipment and intensive manual labor
              required for these therapies limit their availability to
              patients. One alternative solution is to design devices where
              patients could use their upper limbs to provide physical
              assistance to their lower limbs (i.e., self-assistance). To
              explore potential neural effects of coupling upper and lower
              limbs, we investigated neuromuscular recruitment during
              self-driven and externally driven lower limb motion. Healthy
              subjects exercised on a recumbent stepper using different
              combinations of upper and lower limb exertions. The recumbent
              stepper mechanically coupled the upper and lower limbs, allowing
              users to drive the stepping motion with upper and/or lower limbs.
              We instructed subjects to step with 1) active upper and lower
              limbs at an easy resistance level (active arms and legs); 2)
              active upper limbs and relaxed lower limbs at easy, medium, and
              hard resistance levels (self-driven); and 3) relaxed upper and
              lower limbs while another person drove the stepping motion
              (externally driven). We recorded surface electromyography (EMG)
              from six lower limb muscles. Self-driven EMG amplitudes were
              always higher than externally driven EMG amplitudes (P < 0.05).
              As resistance and upper limb exertion increased, self-driven EMG
              amplitudes also increased. EMG bursts during self-driven and
              active arms and legs stepping occurred at similar times. These
              results indicate that active upper limb movement increases
              neuromuscular activation of the lower limbs during cyclic
              stepping motions. Neurologically impaired humans that actively
              engage their upper limbs during gait rehabilitation may increase
              neuromuscular activation and enhance activity-dependent
              plasticity.",

              Sci. Sports Exerc., Vol. 41, No. 9, pp. 1778-1789, 2009. Purpose:
              There are neural connections between the upper and lower limbs of
              humans that enable muscle activation in one limb pair (upper or
              lower) to modulate muscle activation in the other limb pair
              (lower or upper, respectively). The aims of this study were to
              extend previous findings regarding submaximal exercise to maximal
              effort exercise and determine whether there is an ipsilateral or
              contralateral bias to the neural coupling during a rhythmic
              locomotor-like task. Methods: We measured upper and lower limb
              muscle activity, joint kinematics, and limb forces in
              neurologically intact subjects (n = 16) as they performed
              recumbent stepping using different combinations of upper and
              lower limb efforts. Results: We found increased muscle activation
              in passive lower limbs during active upper limb effort compared
              with passive upper limb effort. Likewise, increased muscle
              activation in passive upper limbs occurred during active lower
              limb effort compared with passive lower limb effort, suggesting a
              bidirectional effect. Maximal muscle activation in the active
              lower limbs was not different between conditions with active
              upper limb effort and conditions with passive upper limb
              movement. Similarly, maximal muscle activation in the active
              upper limbs was not different between conditions with active
              lower limb effort and conditions with passive lower limb
              movement. Further comparisons revealed that neural coupling was
              primarily from active upper limb muscles to passive ipsilateral
              lower limb muscles. Conclusions: These findings indicate that
              interlimb neural coupling affects muscle recruitment during
              maximal effort upper and lower limb rhythmic exercise and
              provides insight into the architecture of the neural coupling.",

              different combinations of upper and lower limb efforts. RESULTS:
              There was no significant difference in active lower limb

              were resting or exerting maximal effort. Upper limb effort

  author   = "Huang, Helen J and Ferris, Daniel P",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: When humans perform rhythmic upper and lower limb
              locomotor-like movements, there is an excitatory effect of upper
              limb exertion on lower limb muscle recruitment. To investigate
              potential neural mechanisms for this behavioral observation, we
              developed computer simulations modeling interlimb neural pathways
              among central pattern generators. We hypothesized that
              enhancement of muscle recruitment from interlimb spinal
              mechanisms was not sufficient to explain muscle enhancement
              levels observed in experimental data. METHODS: We used Matsuoka
              oscillators for the central pattern generators (CPG) and
              determined parameters that enhanced amplitudes of rhythmic steady
              state bursts. Potential mechanisms for output enhancement were
              excitatory and inhibitory sensory feedback gains, excitatory and
              inhibitory interlimb coupling gains, and coupling geometry. We
              first simulated the simplest case, a single CPG, and then
              expanded the model to have two CPGs and lastly four CPGs. In the
              two and four CPG models, the lower limb CPGs did not receive
              supraspinal input such that the only mechanisms available for
              enhancing output were interlimb coupling gains and sensory
              feedback gains. RESULTS: In a two-CPG model with inhibitory
              sensory feedback gains, only excitatory gains of ipsilateral
              flexor-extensor/extensor-flexor coupling produced reciprocal
              upper-lower limb bursts and enhanced output up to 26\%. In a
              two-CPG model with excitatory sensory feedback gains, excitatory
              gains of contralateral flexor-flexor/extensor-extensor coupling
              produced reciprocal upper-lower limb bursts and enhanced output
              up to 100\%. However, within a given excitatory sensory feedback
              gain, enhancement due to excitatory interlimb gains could only
              reach levels up to 20\%. Interconnecting four CPGs to have
              ipsilateral flexor-extensor/extensor-flexor coupling,
              contralateral flexor-flexor/extensor-extensor coupling, and
              bilateral flexor-extensor/extensor-flexor coupling could enhance
              motor output up to 32\%. Enhancement observed in experimental
              data exceeded 32\%. Enhancement within this symmetrical four-CPG
              neural architecture was more sensitive to relatively small
              interlimb coupling gains. Excitatory sensory feedback gains could
              produce greater output amplitudes, but larger gains were required
              for entrainment compared to inhibitory sensory feedback gains.
              CONCLUSIONS: Based on these simulations, symmetrical interlimb
              coupling can account for much, but not all of the excitatory
              neural coupling between upper and lower limbs during rhythmic
              locomotor-like movements.",

              procedures for describing similarities and demonstrate the
              importance of this exercise by examining similarities between
              groups on 22 social variables (e.g., moral attitudes, human
              values, and trust) within 6 commonly used social categories:
              gender, age, education, income, nation of residence, and

              Barplots with a restricted y-axis led to a gross underestimation

              Trial-by-trial adaptation is a person's response to
              self-generated errors. Externally-influenced errors applied as
              catch-trial perturbations are used to calculate a person's
              perturbation adaptation rate. Although these adaptation rates are
              sometimes compared to one another, we show through simulation and
              empirical data that the two metrics are distinct. We demonstrate
              that the trial-by-trial adaptation rate, often calculated as a
              coefficient in a linear regression, is biased under typical
              conditions. We tested 12 able-bodied subjects moving a cursor on

               control are clearly demonstrated by the profound impact of
               cortical lesions on the ability to maintain standing balance.
               The cerebral cortex is thought to regulate subcortical postural
               centers to maintain upright balance and posture under varying
               environmental conditions and task demands. However, the cortical
               mechanisms that support standing balance remain elusive. Here,
               we present an EEG-based analysis of cortical oscillatory
               dynamics during the preparation and execution of balance
               responses with distinct postural demands. In our experiment,
               participants responded to backward movements of the support
               surface either with one forward step or by keeping their feet in
               place. To challenge the postural control system, we applied
               participant-specific high accelerations of the support surface
               such that the postural demand was low for stepping responses and
               high for feet-in-place responses. We expected that postural
               demand modulated the power of intrinsic cortical oscillations.
               Independent component analysis and time-frequency domain
               statistics revealed stronger suppression of alpha (9-13 Hz) and
               low-gamma (31-34 Hz) rhythms in the supplementary motor area
               (SMA) when preparing for feet-in-place responses (i.e., high
               postural demand). Irrespective of the response condition,
               support-surface movements elicited broadband (3-17 Hz) power
               increase in the SMA and enhancement of the theta (3-7 Hz) rhythm
               in the anterior prefrontal cortex (PFC), anterior cingulate
               cortex (ACC), and bilateral sensorimotor cortices (M1/S1).
               Although the execution of reactive responses resulted in largely
               similar cortical dynamics, comparison between the bilateral
               M1/S1 showed that stepping responses corresponded with stronger
               suppression of the beta (13-17 Hz) rhythm in the M1/S1
               contralateral to the support leg. Comparison between response
               conditions showed that feet-in-place responses corresponded with
               stronger enhancement of the theta (3-7 Hz) rhythm in the PFC.

  abstract  = "Nowadays the rapid development in the area of human-computer
               interaction has given birth to a growing interest on detecting
               different affective states through smart devices. By using the
               modern sensor equipment, we can easily collect
               electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, which capture the
               information from central nervous system and are closely related
               with our brain activities. Through the training on EEG signals,
               we can make reasonable analysis on people's affection, which is
               very promising in various areas. Unfortunately, the special
               properties of EEG dataset have brought difficulties for
               conventional machine learning methods. The main reasons lie in
               two aspects: the small set of labeled samples and the noisy
               channel problem. To overcome these difficulties and successfully
               identify the affective states, we come up with a novel
               semi-supervised deep structured framework. Compared with
               previous deep learning models, our method is more adapted to the
               EEG classification problem. We first adopt a two-level
               procedure, which involves both supervised label information and
               unsupervised structure information to jointly make decision on
               channel selection. And then, we add a generative Restricted
               Boltzmann Machine (RBM) model for the classification task, and
               use the training objectives of generative learning and
               unsupervised learning to jointly regularize the discriminative
               training. Finally, we extend it to the active learning scenario,
               which solves the costly labeling problem. The experiments
               conducted on real EEG dataset have shown both the convincing
               result on critical channel selection and the superiority of our
               method over multiple baselines for the affective state
               recognition.",

  abstract      = "One of the challenges in modeling cognitive events from
                   electroencephalogram (EEG) data is finding representations
                   that are invariant to inter- and intra-subject differences,
                   as well as to inherent noise associated with such data.
                   Herein, we propose a novel approach for learning such
                   representations from multi-channel EEG time-series, and
                   demonstrate its advantages in the context of mental load
                   classification task. First, we transform EEG activities into
                   a sequence of topology-preserving multi-spectral images, as
                   opposed to standard EEG analysis techniques that ignore such
                   spatial information. Next, we train a deep
                   recurrent-convolutional network inspired by state-of-the-art
                   video classification to learn robust representations from
                   the sequence of images. The proposed approach is designed to
                   preserve the spatial, spectral, and temporal structure of
                   EEG which leads to finding features that are less sensitive
                   to variations and distortions within each dimension.
                   Empirical evaluation on the cognitive load classification
                   task demonstrated significant improvements in classification
                   accuracy over current state-of-the-art approaches in this

               has revolutionized computer vision through end-to-end learning,
               that is, learning from the raw data. There is increasing
               interest in using deep ConvNets for end-to-end EEG analysis, but
               a better understanding of how to design and train ConvNets for
               end-to-end EEG decoding and how to visualize the informative EEG
               features the ConvNets learn is still needed. Here, we studied
               deep ConvNets with a range of different architectures, designed
               for decoding imagined or executed tasks from raw EEG. Our
               results show that recent advances from the machine learning
               field, including batch normalization and exponential linear
               units, together with a cropped training strategy, boosted the
               deep ConvNets decoding performance, reaching at least as good
               performance as the widely used filter bank common spatial
               patterns (FBCSP) algorithm (mean decoding accuracies 82.1\%
               FBCSP, 84.0\% deep ConvNets). While FBCSP is designed to use
               spectral power modulations, the features used by ConvNets are
               not fixed a priori. Our novel methods for visualizing the
               learned features demonstrated that ConvNets indeed learned to
               use spectral power modulations in the alpha, beta, and high
               gamma frequencies, and proved useful for spatially mapping the
               learned features by revealing the topography of the causal
               contributions of features in different frequency bands to the
               decoding decision. Our study thus shows how to design and train
               ConvNets to decode task-related information from the raw EEG
               without handcrafted features and highlights the potential of
               deep ConvNets combined with advanced visualization techniques
               for EEG-based brain mapping. Hum Brain Mapp 38:5391-5420, 2017.

               has been thoroughly revised and updated by a team of
               internationally recognized and clinically experienced
               neuropsychologists. Drawing on their diverse interests, they
               provide authoritative, broad-based, and in-depth coverage of
               current research and clinical practice in neuropsychology. They
               have not, however, changed the book's overall organization. The
               first eight chapters present the knowledge base for
               understanding the principles and practice of patient-oriented,
               hypothesis-testing neuropsychological assessment. The last 12
               chapters review nearly all tests and assessment techniques
               discussed in previous editions plus many new ones and recent
               revisions of older tests. The extent of the updating is apparent
               from the fact that approximately half of the more than 7,000
               references cited appeared since the last edition was
               published.Many new topics relevant to current assessment
               practices have been added to the 4th edition. The chapter on
               examination procedures, for example, now contains sections on
               cognitive functioning in pain and PTSD patients. The chapter on
               brain disorders includes new material on electrical/lighting
               injuries, migraine, Alzheimer's disease and other dementing
               disorders, and both medical and psychological treatments. The
               discussion of assessment procedures has been updated throughout
               to cover recently published test batteries used in general
               neuropsychological assessment (e.g., mental abilities, memory),
               newly developed batteries for specific issues (e.g., frontal
               lobe evaluation), and recent research on older
               neuropsychological assessment batteries. The fully revised
               chapter on assessing response bias describes and evaluates more
               than 60 tests, test combinations, and other measures for
               detecting questionable effort within the context of forensic
               neuropsychological assessment.",

                kinetics is a camera-based motion capture system in combination
                with force measurement platforms. Alternatively, inertial
                measurement units can be utilized to obtain human kinematics,
                while ground reaction forces are computed from full body
                dynamics. This setup represents a system independent from the
                spatial confinement of a gait laboratory. The aim of this study
                is the comparison of the two methods by the investigation of
                lower limb kinematics and the resulting joint reaction forces
                within the ankle-, knee- and hip joints. For this purpose,
                human motion during gait was captured simultaneously by both
                measurement techniques. 13 trials from 8 different test
                subjects were evaluated in total. IMU data was processed with a
                quaternion based Kalman Filter. The data sets were implemented
                into a musculoskeletal simulation program in order to drive a
                virtual human body model. Each sensor was aligned to the
                gravitational and magnetic field vectors of the earth. The
                angles of flexions, extensions and rotations were analyzed to
                determine kinematic differences. Joint reaction forces defined
                kinetic dissimilarities. The overall kinematic differences of
                both models yielded root mean square errors of 7.62°, 6.02°,
                4.95°, 2.79°, 2.38° and 3.56° for ankle flexion, subtalar
                eversion, knee flexion, hip external rotation, hip abduction
                and hip flexion, respectively. The proximo-distal differences
                in force peaks between the models yielded overall for the
                ankle, 57.33 \%Bodyweight(BW) $\pm$ 46.86 \%BW (16.66
                \%(Maximum peak to peak) $\pm$ 13.62 \%) for the knee 37.09
                \%BW $\pm$ 29.33 \%BW (17.65 \% $\pm$ 15.44 \%) and 32.03 \%BW
                $\pm$ 24.33 \%BW (15.6 \% $\pm$ 12.54 \%) for the hip. The
                overall outcome of this work investigated an approach
                independent of the common setup of the gait laboratory, thus
                enabling a cheaper and more flexible technology as an
                alternative. However, kinematic and thus kinetic differences
                remain rather large. Future work aims to improve the contact
                criterion for the calculation of the ground reaction forces and
                the implementation of a full-body calibration algorithm for the
                IMU system in order to counteract magnetic field disturbances.",

  abstract = "Recent research suggests that the nervous system controls muscles

              produce a wide repertoire of movements. Muscle synergies are like
              building blocks, defining characteristic patterns of activation
              across multiple muscles that may be unique to each individual,

              ``problems'' to the nervous system, the redundancy of biological
              systems and variability in their behaviors may actually be
              exploited to allow for the flexible achievement of multiple and

              variability may reflect the constant ``tuning'' of
              neuromechanical elements and their interactions for movement
              control. The problem faced by researchers is that there is no
              one-to-one mapping between the task goal and the coordination of
              the underlying elements. We review recent and ongoing research in
              postural control with the goal of identifying common mechanisms
              underlying variability in postural control, coordination of
              multiple postural strategies, and transitions between them. We

  abstract = "Muscle coordination may be difficult or impossible to predict
              accurately based on biomechanical considerations alone because of
              redundancy in the musculoskeletal system. Because many solutions
              exist for any given movement, the role of the nervous system in
              further constraining muscle coordination patterns for movement
              must be considered in both healthy and impaired motor control. On
              the basis of computational neuromechanical analyses of
              experimental data combined with modeling techniques, we have
              demonstrated several such neural constraints on the temporal and
              spatial patterns of muscle activity during both locomotion and
              postural responses to balance perturbations. We hypothesize that
              subject-specific and trial-by-trial differences in muscle
              activation can be parameterized and understood by a hierarchical
              and low-dimensional framework that reflects the neural control of
              task-level goals. In postural control, we demonstrate that
              temporal patterns of muscle activity may be governed by feedback
              control of task-level variables that represent the overall
              goal-directed motion of the body. These temporal patterns then
              recruit spatially-fixed patterns of muscle activity called muscle
              synergies that produce the desired task-level biomechanical
              functions that require multijoint coordination. Moreover, these
              principles apply more generally to movement, and in particular to
              locomotor tasks in both healthy and impaired individuals.
              Overall, understanding the goals and organization of the neural
              control of movement may provide useful reduced dimension
              parameter sets to address the degrees-of-freedom problem in
              musculoskeletal movement control. More importantly, however,
              neuromechanical analyses may lend insight and provide a framework
              for understanding subject-specific and trial-by-trial differences
              in movement across both healthy and motor-impaired populations.",

  abstract = "Interlimb coordination is essential to perform goal-directed
              daily tasks and purposeful locomotion. The coordination occurs
              due to spatiotemporal coupling of movements, which also comprises
              interactions in segmental kinematics, joint dynamics, and muscle
              activity. Neuroanatomical and neurophysiological linkages at the
              spinal and brain level are responsible for the coordination. The
              linkage is termed ``neural coupling''. According to the task
              demand, the coupling may occur between two upper limbs or two
              lower limbs or all four limbs. Central pattern generators play a
              key role in interlimb coordination by regulating the rhythmic
              upper and lower limb movements. Neuroanatomically, multiple areas
              of both cerebral hemispheres via the corpus callosum interact and
              control the bimanual upper limb movements. There is an
              interhemispheric synchronization and disinhibition to control the
              coupled bimanual upper and lower limb movements. Movement of the
              upper limb also enhances neuromuscular recruitment of the lower
              limb. In stroke, bimanual motor impairments exist in the form of
              asymmetry and reduced coordination, which may be related to
              weakness of the ipsilateral body side lesser than the
              contralateral side. The aim of the present review was to

              on subjects making small, discrete movements of the hands and
              feet. The purpose of this study was to determine if high-density
              electroencephalography (EEG) could detect differences in cortical
              activity and connectivity during active and viewed rhythmic arm
              and leg movements in humans. Our primary hypothesis was that we
              would detect similar but weaker electrocortical spectral
              fluctuations and effective connectivity fluctuations during
              viewed limb exercise compared to active limb exercise due to the
              similarities in neural recruitment. A secondary hypothesis was
              that we would record stronger cortical spectral fluctuations for
              arm exercise compared to leg exercise, because rhythmic arm
              exercise would be more dependent on supraspinal control than
              rhythmic leg exercise. We recorded EEG data while ten young
              healthy subjects exercised on a recumbent stepper with: (1) both
              arms and legs, (2) just legs, and (3) just arms. Subjects also
              viewed video playback of themselves or another individual
              performing the same exercises. We performed independent component
              analysis, dipole fitting, spectral analysis, and effective
              connectivity analysis on the data. Cortical areas comprising the
              premotor and supplementary motor cortex, the anterior cingulate,
              the posterior cingulate, and the parietal cortex exhibited
              significant spectral fluctuations during rhythmic limb exercise.
              These fluctuations tended to be greater for the arms exercise
              conditions than for the legs only exercise condition, which
              suggests that human rhythmic arm movements are under stronger
              cortical control than rhythmic leg movements. We did not find
              consistent spectral fluctuations in these areas during the viewed
              conditions, but effective connectivity fluctuated at harmonics of
              the exercise frequency during both active and viewed rhythmic
              limb exercise. The right premotor and supplementary motor cortex
              drove the network. These results suggest that a similarly

              displacement during automatic postural responses to support
              surface perturbations. METHODS: Individuals with PD (n = 26) were
              recruited for high-volume Adapted Tango (15 lessons, 1.5 hour
              each over 3 weeks). Twenty participants were assessed with
              clinical balance and gait measures before and after the
              intervention. Nine participants were also assessed with
              support-surface translation perturbations. RESULTS: Overall
              adherence to the intervention was 77\%. At posttest, peak forward
              CoM displacement was reduced (4.0 +/- 0.9 cm, pretest, vs 3.7 +/-
              1.1 cm, posttest; P = 0.03; Cohen's d = 0.30) and correlated to
              improvements on Berg Balance Scale (rho = -0.68; P = 0.04) and
              Dynamic Gait Index (rho = -0.75; P = 0.03). Overall antagonist
              onset time was delayed (27 ms; P = 0.02; d = 0.90) and duration
              was reduced (56 ms, approximately 39\%, P = 0.02; d = 0.45).
              Reductions in EMG magnitude were also observed (P < 0.05).
              DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Following participation in Adapted
              Tango, changes in kinematic and some EMG measures of perturbation
              responses were observed in addition to improvements in clinical
              measures. We conclude that 3-week, high-volume Adapted Tango is

              neuroscience. Amplitudes of early latency cutaneous reflexes

              leg or arm cycling but not during limb positioning or voluntary
              contraction. This suggests that interneurons mediating ELCRs to
              arm muscles integrate outputs from neural systems controlling
              rhythmic limb movements. Alternatively, outputs could be
              integrated at the motoneuron and/or supraspinal levels. We
              examined whether a separate effect on the ELCR pathways and
              cortico-motoneuronal excitability during arm and leg cycling is
              integrated by neural elements common to the lumbo-sacral and

              contralateral arm and bilateral leg cycling (A\&L), while ELCRs

              during ARM and LEG. A low stimulus intensity during ARM or LEG
              generated a larger ELCR during A\&L than the sum of ELCRs during
              ARM and LEG. We confirmed this nonlinear increase in single motor
              unit firing probability following SR nerve stimulation during
              A\&L. Furthermore, motor-evoked potentials following transcranial
              magnetic and electrical stimulation did not show nonlinear
              potentiation during A\&L. These findings suggest the existence of
              a common neural element of the ELCR reflex pathway that is active
              only during rhythmic arm and leg movement and receives convergent
              input from contralateral arms and legs.",

              for rehabilitation clinicians and researchers alike. One possible
              strategy is the use of sensory modalities to elicit adaptive
              locomotor gait patterns. This study aimed to explore to what
              extent haptic inputs, in the form of forward-leading tensile
              forces delivered to the hand, compared to no force, may lead to
              adaptation and post-adaptation effects on gait parameters, during
              and after the haptic exposure, respectively. METHODS: Thirteen
              healthy young individuals were recruited for this study. We
              developed an innovative system combining virtual reality and
              haptic tensile forces in the direction of locomotion to simulate
              walking with a dog. A robotic arm generated forces via an adapted
              leash to the participant's hand while they walked on a self-paced
              treadmill immersed in a virtual environment with scene
              progression synchronized to the treadmill. RESULTS: All
              participants showed significant increases in instantaneous gait
              velocity and stride length, with accompanying decreases in
              double-limb support time (p < 0.05) when walking with a haptic
              tensile force of either 10 or 20 N, relative to pre-force epoch
              levels, indicating an adaptation effect. When the 10 or 20 N
              force was removed, gait measures generally remained changed
              relative to baseline pre-force levels (p < 0.05), providing
              evidence of a post-adaptation effect. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in
              spatiotemporal outcomes provide evidence that both adaptation and
              post-adaptation effects were present in response to the
              application and removal of a haptic force. Future studies will
              investigate whether similar changes in elderly and post-stroke

  abstract = "Holes in the skull may have a large influence on the EEG and ERP.
              Inverse source modeling techniques such as dipole fitting require
              an accurate volume conductor model. This model should incorporate
              holes if present, especially when either a neuronal generator or
              the electrodes are close to the hole, e.g., in case of a trephine
              hole in the upper part of the skull. The boundary element method
              (BEM) is at present the preferred method for inverse computations
              using a realistic head model, because of its efficiency and
              availability. Using a simulation approach, we have studied the
              accuracy of the BEM by comparing it to the analytical solution
              for a volume conductor without a hole, and to the finite
              difference method (FDM) for one with a hole. Furthermore, we have
              evaluated the influence of holes on the results of forward and
              inverse computations using the BEM. Without a hole and compared
              to the analytical model, a three-sphere BEM model was accurate up
              to 5-10\%, while the corresponding FDM model had an error <0.5\%.
              In the presence of a hole, the difference between the BEM and the
              FDM was, on average, 4\% (1.3-11.4\%). The FDM turned out to be
              very accurate if no hole is present. We believe that the
              difference between the BEM and the FDM represents the inaccuracy
              of the BEM. This inaccuracy in the BEM is very small compared to
              the effect that holes can have on the scalp potential (up to
              450\%). In regard to the large influence of holes on forward and
              inverse computations, we conclude that holes in the skull can be
              treated reliably by means of the BEM and should be incorporated
              in forward and inverse modeling.",

  abstract = "Different cortical source localization methods have been
              developed to directly link the scalp potentials with the cortical
              activities. Up to now, these methods are the only possible
              solution to noninvasively investigate cortical activities with
              both high spatial and time resolutions. However, the application
              of these methods is hindered by the fact that they have not been
              rigorously evaluated nor compared. In this paper, the
              performances of several source localization methods (moving
              dipoles, minimum Lp norm, and low resolution tomography (LRT)
              with Lp norm, p equal to 1, 1.5, and 2) were evaluated by using
              simulated scalp EEG data, scalp somatosensory evoked potentials

              on human subjects (all with 163 scalp electrodes). By using
              simulated EEG data, we first evaluated the source localization
              ability of the above methods quantitatively. Subsequently, the
              performance of the various methods was evaluated qualitatively by
              using experimental SEPs and MRPs. Our results show that the

              localization ability than any of the other investigated methods
              and provides physiologically meaningful reconstruction results.

  abstract = "Although human cognition often occurs during dynamic motor
              actions, most studies of human brain dynamics examine subjects in
              static seated or prone conditions. EEG signals have historically
              been considered to be too noise prone to allow recording of brain
              dynamics during human locomotion. Here we applied a channel-based
              artifact template regression procedure and a subsequent spatial
              filtering approach to remove gait-related movement artifact from
              EEG signals recorded during walking and running. We first used
              stride time warping to remove gait artifact from high-density EEG
              recorded during a visual oddball discrimination task performed
              while walking and running. Next, we applied infomax independent
              component analysis (ICA) to parse the channel-based noise reduced
              EEG signals into maximally independent components (ICs) and then
              performed component-based template regression. Applying
              channel-based or channel-based plus component-based artifact
              rejection significantly reduced EEG spectral power in the 1.5- to
              8.5-Hz frequency range during walking and running. In walking
              conditions, gait-related artifact was insubstantial:
              event-related potentials (ERPs), which were nearly identical to
              visual oddball discrimination events while standing, were visible
              before and after applying noise reduction. In the running
              condition, gait-related artifact severely compromised the EEG
              signals: stable average ERP time-courses of IC processes were
              only detectable after artifact removal. These findings show that
              high-density EEG can be used to study brain dynamics during whole
              body movements and that mechanical artifact from rhythmic gait
              events may be minimized using a template regression procedure.",

              However, techniques that have been used to image the brain during
              locomotion lack the temporal resolution necessary to assess
              intra-stride cortical dynamics. Our aim was to determine if
              electrocortical activity is coupled to gait cycle phase during
              steady-speed human walking. We used electroencephalography (EEG),

              on a treadmill. Infomax independent component analysis (ICA)

              processes representing electrocortical sources, muscle sources,
              and artifacts. We calculated a spatially fixed equivalent current
              dipole for each IC using an inverse modeling approach, and
              clustered electrocortical sources across subjects by similarities
              in dipole locations and power spectra. We then computed
              spectrograms for each electrocortical source that were
              time-locked to the gait cycle. Electrocortical sources in the
              anterior cingulate, posterior parietal, and sensorimotor cortex
              exhibited significant (p<0.05) intra-stride changes in spectral
              power. During the end of stance, as the leading foot was
              contacting the ground and the trailing foot was pushing off,
              alpha- and beta-band spectral power increased in or near the
              left/right sensorimotor and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex.
              Power increases in the left/right sensorimotor cortex were more
              pronounced for contralateral limb push-off (ipsilateral
              heel-strike) than for ipsilateral limb push-off (contralateral
              heel-strike). Intra-stride high-gamma spectral power changes were
              evident in anterior cingulate, posterior parietal, and
              sensorimotor cortex. These data confirm cortical involvement in
              steady-speed human locomotion. Future applications of these
              techniques could provide critical insight into the neural
              mechanisms of movement disorders and gait rehabilitation.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Electroencephalography (EEG) can assess brain activity
              during whole-body motion in humans but head motion can induce
              artifacts that obfuscate electrocortical signals. Definitive
              solutions for removing motion artifact from EEG have yet to be
              found, so creating methods to assess signal processing routines
              for removing motion artifact are needed. We present a novel
              method for investigating the influence of head motion on EEG
              recordings as well as for assessing the efficacy of signal
              processing approaches intended to remove motion artifact.
              APPROACH: We used a phantom head device to mimic electrical
              properties of the human head with three controlled dipolar
              sources of electrical activity embedded in the phantom. We
              induced sinusoidal vertical motions on the phantom head using a
              custom-built platform and recorded EEG signals with three
              different acquisition systems while the head was both stationary
              and in varied motion conditions. MAIN RESULTS: Recordings showed
              up to 80\% reductions in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and up to
              3600\% increases in the power spectrum as a function of motion
              amplitude and frequency. Independent component analysis (ICA)
              successfully isolated the three dipolar sources across all
              conditions and systems. There was a high correlation (r > 0.85)
              and marginal increase in the independent components' (ICs) power
              spectrum ( approximately 15\%) when comparing stationary and
              motion parameters. The SNR of the IC activation was 400\%-700\%
              higher in comparison to the channel data SNR, attenuating the
              effects of motion on SNR. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that
              the phantom head and motion platform can be used to assess motion
              artifact removal algorithms and compare different EEG systems for
              motion artifact sensitivity. In addition, ICA is effective in
              isolating target electrocortical events and marginally improving
              SNR in relation to stationary recordings.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to evaluate the ability of a dual
              electrode approach to remove motion artifact from

              phantom human head model and robotic motion platform to induce
              motion while collecting scalp EEG. We assembled a dual electrode
              array capturing (a) artificial neural signals plus noise from
              scalp EEG electrodes, and (b) electrically isolated motion
              artifact noise. We recorded artificial neural signals broadcast
              from antennae in the phantom head during continuous vertical
              sinusoidal movements (stationary, 1.00, 1.25, 1.50, 1.75, 2.00 Hz

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Gait impairments during real-world locomotion are
              common in neurological diseases. However, very little is
              currently known about the neural correlates of walking in the
              real world and on which regions of the brain are involved in
              regulating gait stability and performance. As a first step to
              understanding how neural control of gait may be impaired in
              neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease, we
              investigated how regional brain activation might predict walking
              performance in the urban environment and whilst engaging with
              secondary tasks in healthy subjects. METHODS: We recorded gait
              characteristics including trunk acceleration and brain activation
              in 14 healthy young subjects whilst they walked around the
              university campus freely (single task), while conversing with the
              experimenter and while texting with their smartphone. Neural
              spectral power density (PSD) was evaluated in three brain regions
              of interest, namely the pre-frontal cortex (PFC) and bilateral
              posterior parietal cortex (right/left PPC). We hypothesized that
              specific regional neural activation would predict trunk
              acceleration data obtained during the different walking
              conditions. RESULTS: Vertical trunk acceleration was predicted by
              gait velocity and left PPC theta (4-7 Hz) band PSD in single-task
              walking (R-squared = 0.725, p = 0.001) and by gait velocity and
              left PPC alpha (8-12 Hz) band PSD in walking while conversing
              (R-squared = 0.727, p = 0.001). Medio-lateral trunk acceleration
              was predicted by left PPC beta (15-25 Hz) band PSD when walking
              while texting (R-squared = 0.434, p = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: We
              suggest that the left PPC may be involved in the processes of
              sensorimotor integration and gait control during walking in
              real-world conditions. Frequency-specific coding was operative in
              different dual tasks and may be developed as biomarkers of gait
              deficits in neurological conditions during performance of these
              types of, now commonly undertaken, dual tasks.",

              This paper presents two novel techniques for kinematic heel

              horizontal heel displacement (HHD). Each of these HHD techniques

              techniques, along with other previously established techniques,
              were validated against a 10N force plate threshold. Fifty-four
              healthy adults walked overground at both normal and fast speeds

              significantly outperformed (p<0.0001) the established techniques.
              Gait speed was shown to have a significant effect (p<0.0001) on

              contribute to the metabolic cost of locomotion? This study
              examined the effects of walking and running speed on lower limb
              joint mechanics and metabolic cost of transport in humans.
              Kinematic and kinetic data for 10 participants were collected for

  abstract = "HIGHLIGHTS Both spatial and temporal analyses of the Center of
              Pressure demonstrate that children with ADHD have poorer postural
              control than typically developing sex-, age-, and IQ-matched
              children.Poor sensory integration in postural control could
              partially explained the deficits in postural stability in
              children with ADHD.MPH treatment improves postural performance in
              both spatial and temporal domains in children with ADHD.MPH
              improves postural control specifically when visual and
              proprioceptive inputs are misleading.Such improvement could be
              due to MPH effects on neurons, facilitating cerebellar processing
              of postural control. The aim of this study was to examine
              postural control in children with ADHD and explore the effect of
              methylphenidate (MPH), using spatial and temporal analyses of the
              center of pressure (CoP). Thirty-eight children with ADHD (mean
              age 9.82 +/- 0.37 years) and 38 sex- age- and IQ-matched children
              with typically development were examined. Postural stability was
              evaluated using the Multitest Equilibre machine (Framiral(R)) at
              inclusion and after 1 month of MPH in children with ADHD.
              Postural stability was assessed by recording under several
              conditions: with eyes open and fixed on a target, with eyes
              closed and with vision perturbed by optokinetic stimulation, on
              stable and unstable platforms. At inclusion, we observed poor
              spatial and temporal postural stability in children with ADHD.
              The spectral power index was higher in children with ADHD than in
              controls. Canceling time was shorter at low and medium
              frequencies of oscillation and longer at higher frequencies in
              children with ADHD. After 1 month of MPH, the surface area and
              mean velocity of the CoP decreased significantly under the most
              complex conditions (unstable platform in the absence of
              proprioceptive and visual inputs). The spectral power index
              decreased significantly after MPH while the canceling time did
              not change. Poor postural control in children with ADHD supports
              the hypothesis of cerebellar dysfunction in this disorder.
              Postural control could be improved by a more efficient processing
              of sensory inputs (a high-level process), as suggested by the
              decrease in spectral power index after MPH without changes in the
              canceling time (a low-level process).",

              Muscle coordination deficits, in the form of inappropriately
              phased muscle activity patterns, are well recognized in both the
              paretic and non-paretic limbs of stroke survivors. Our recent
              work demonstrated that muscle phasing can be systematically
              influenced by changing the relative angular positions of limbs in
              both neurologically intact individuals and people post-stroke.
              However, it is still unknown whether the observed transient
              changes in adjusted muscle phasing can be adapted following a
              short-bout of training on the split-crank ergometer. To explore
              the extent to which the non-paretic and paretic limbs of people
              with stroke can adapt to new muscle activity phasing changes, we
              examined the adaptation of muscle phasing following a short-bout
              of pedaling training at two specific relative spatial angular
              positions of limbs that had caused the greatest phasing changes

              stroke and twelve age- and gender-matched control subjects
              participated in this study. We demonstrated that both intact and
              cerebrally impaired nervous systems are capable of adapting new
              muscle phasing patterns and producing aftereffects that persisted
              for at least 10 min. However, we observed a completely different
              trend of aftereffects in post-stroke subjects compared with
              controls. Specifically, in controls, the aftereffects were
              observed only in the leg that was in the following position
              during the adaptation training whereas in post-stroke subjects,
              aftereffects were observed only in the leg that acted as the
              leading leg during adaptation, regardless of the limb being
              paretic or non-paretic. These findings suggest that adapting a
              new muscle activity pattern during a bilateral locomotor task
              depends mainly on the relative temporal position of contralateral
              limb.",

               training activates interlimb CPG networks for locomotion remains
               unclear and was assessed by studying chronic stroke participants
               before and after 5 wk of arm cycling training. Strength was
               assessed bilaterally via maximal voluntary isometric
               contractions in the legs and hands. Muscle activation during arm
               cycling and transfer to treadmill walking were assessed in the
               more affected (MA) and less affected (LA) sides via surface
               electromyography. Changes to interlimb coupling during rhythmic
               movement were evaluated using modulation of cutaneous reflexes
               elicited by electrical stimulation of the superficial radial
               nerve at the wrist. Bilateral soleus stretch reflexes were
               elicited at rest and during 1-Hz arm cycling. Clinical function
               tests assessed walking, balance, and motor function. Results
               show significant changes in function and neurophysiological
               integrity. Training increased bilateral grip strength, force

               ``Normalization'' of cutaneous reflex modulation was found
               during arm cycling. There was enhanced activity in the
               dorsiflexor muscles on the MA side during the swing phase of
               walking. Enhanced interlimb coupling was shown by increased
               modulation of MA soleus stretch reflex amplitudes during arm
               cycling after training. Clinical evaluations showed enhanced
               walking ability and balance. These results are consistent with
               training-induced changes in CPG function and interlimb
               connectivity and underscore the need for arm training in the

               NOTEWORTHY It has been suggested but not tested that training
               the arms may influence rehabilitation of walking due to
               activation of interneuronal patterning networks after stroke. We
               show that arm cycling training improves strength, clinical
               function, coordination of muscle activity during walking, and
               neurological connectivity between the arms and the legs. The

              involve the arms. The goal of this project was to assess the
              effect of a rehabilitation strategy involving simultaneous arm
              and leg cycling on improving walking after incomplete spinal cord
              injury (iSCI). We investigated the effect of 1) non-gait-specific
              training and 2) active arm involvement during training on changes
              in over ground walking capacity. Participants with iSCI were
              assigned to simultaneous arm-leg cycling (A\&L) or legs only
              cycling (Leg) training paradigms, and cycling movements were
              assisted with electrical stimulation. Overground walking speed
              significantly increased by 0.092 $\pm$ 0.022 m/s in the Leg group
              and 0.27 $\pm$ 0.072m/s in the A\&L group after training. Whereas
              the increases in the Leg group were similar to those seen after
              current locomotor training strategies, increases in the A\&L
              group were significantly larger than those in the Leg group.
              Walking distance also significantly increased by 32.12 $\pm$ 8.74
              m in the Leg and 91.58 $\pm$ 36.24 m in the A\&L group. Muscle
              strength, sensation, and balance improved in both groups;
              however, the A\&L group had significant improvements in most gait
              measures and had more regulated joint kinematics and muscle
              activity after training compared with the Leg group. We conclude
              that electrical stimulation-assisted cycling training can produce
              significant improvements in walking after SCI. Furthermore,
              active arm involvement during training can produce greater
              improvements in walking performance. This strategy may also be
              effective in people with other neural disorders or diseases. NEW
              \& NOTEWORTHY This work challenges concepts of task-specific
              training for the rehabilitation of walking and encourages
              coordinated training of the arms and legs after spinal cord
              injury. Cycling of the legs produced significant improvements in
              walking that were similar in magnitude to those reported with
              gait-specific training. Moreover, active engagement of the arms
              simultaneously with the legs generated nearly double the
              improvements obtained by leg training only. The cervico-lumbar
              networks are critical for the improvement of walking.",

               first, 22 neurologically intact (NI) people and 10 people with
               chronic iSCI were recruited. The change in H-reflex amplitude in
               flexor carpi radialis (FCR) during leg cycling and H-reflex
               amplitude in soleus (SOL) during arm cycling were investigated.
               In the second study, two groups of participants with chronic
               iSCI underwent 12 weeks of cycling training: one performed
               combined arm and leg cycling (A\&L) and the other legs only
               cycling (Leg). The effect of training paradigm on the amplitude

               amplitude of both FCR and SOL H-reflexes during dynamic cycling

               reduction in the SOL H-reflex during dynamic arm cycling in iSCI
               participants after training. Substantial improvements in SOL
               H-reflex properties were found in the A\&L group after training.
               The results demonstrate that cervico-lumbar modulation during
               rhythmic movements is disrupted in people with chronic iSCI;
               however, this modulation is restored after cycling training.
               Furthermore, involvement of the arms simultaneously with the
               legs during training may better regulate the leg spinal
               reflexes.",

               We conducted a cross-sectional study, analyzed by univariate and
               multivariate regression models. Between- and within-group
               differences were examined during (a) ACE only, (b) ACE combined

               VO2peak tests during ACE only, ACE-PLC, and FES hybrid were
               performed in random order on separate days. Results: In the

              template, and presenting pronounced amplitude in comparison to

               artifact, poses a serious threat to the validity of
               electroencephalography (EEG) investigations in the frequency
               domain. EMG is sensitive to a variety of psychological processes
               and can mask genuine effects or masquerade as legitimate
               neurogenic effects across the scalp in frequencies at least as
               low as the alpha band (8-13 Hz). Although several techniques for
               correcting myogenic activity have been described, most are
               subjected to only limited validation attempts. Attempts to gauge
               the impact of EMG correction on intracerebral source models
               (source ``localization'' analyses) are rarer still. Accordingly,
               we assessed the sensitivity and specificity of one prominent
               correction tool, independent component analysis (ICA), on the
               scalp and in the source-space using high-resolution EEG. Data
               were collected from 17 participants while neurogenic and
               myogenic activity was independently varied. Several protocols
               for classifying and discarding components classified as myogenic
               and non-myogenic artifact (e.g., ocular) were systematically
               assessed, leading to the exclusion of one-third to as much as
               three-quarters of the variance in the EEG. Some, but not all, of
               these protocols showed adequate performance on the scalp.
               Indeed, performance was superior to previously validated
               regression-based techniques. Nevertheless, ICA-based EMG
               correction exhibited low validity in the intracerebral
               source-space, likely owing to incomplete separation of
               neurogenic from myogenic sources. Taken with prior work, this
               indicates that EMG artifact can substantially distort estimates
               of intracerebral spectral activity. Neither regression- nor
               ICA-based EMG correction techniques provide complete safeguards
               against such distortions. In light of these results, several
               practical suggestions and recommendations are made for
               intelligently using ICA to minimize EMG and other common
               artifacts.",

               from the scalp. To understand how is it possible to observe
               these small events on the scalp, one avenue is the analysis of
               the cortical correlates at the time of scalp HFOs. Using
               simultaneous scalp and intracranial recordings of 11 patients,
               we studied the spatial distribution of scalp events on the
               cortical surface. For typical interictal epileptiform discharges
               the subdural distributions were, as expected, spatially
               extended. On the contrary, for scalp HFOs the subdural maps
               corresponded to focal sources, consisting of one or a few small
               spatial extent activations. These topographies suggest that
               small cortical areas generated the HFOs seen on the scalp.
               Similar scalp distributions corresponded to distinct
               distributions on a standard 1 cm subdural grid and averaging
               similar scalp HFOs resulted in focal subdural maps. The
               assumption that a subdural grid ``sees'' everything that
               contributes to the potential of nearby scalp contacts was not
               valid for HFOs. The results suggest that these small extent
               events are spatially undersampled with standard scalp and grid
               inter-electrode distances. High-density scalp electrode
               distributions seem necessary to obtain a solid sampling of HFOs

               differences as a function of electrode density and electrolyte
               spreading were examined and a method for correcting these
               differences was tested. METHODS: Separate EEG recordings from 8
               participants were made using a high-density electrode net, first
               with 6 of 128 electrodes active followed by recordings with all
               electrodes active. For a subset of 4 participants measurements
               were counterbalanced with recordings made in the reversed order
               by drying the hair after the high-density recordings and using a
               fresh dry electrode net of the same size for the low-density
               recordings. Mean power values over 6 resting eyes open/closed
               EEG recordings at the 6 active electrodes common to both
               recording conditions were compared. Evidence for possible
               electrolyte spreading or bridging between electrodes was
               acquired by computing Hjorth electrical distances. Spherical
               spline interpolation was tested for correcting power values at
               electrodes affected by electrolyte spreading for these
               participants and for a subset of participants from a larger
               previous study. RESULTS: For both the complete set and the
               counterbalanced subset, significant decreases in power at the 6
               common electrodes for the high-density recordings were observed
               across the range of the standard EEG bands (1-44 Hz). The number
               of bridges or amount of electrolyte spreading towards the
               reference electrode as evidenced by small Hjorth electrical
               distances served as a predictor of this power decrease.
               Spherical spline interpolation increased the power values at
               electrodes affected by electrolyte spreading and by a
               significant amount for the larger number of participants in the
               second group. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding signal effects caused
               by closely spaced electrodes, detecting electrolyte spreading
               and correcting its effects are important considerations for
               high-density EEG recordings. A combination of scalp maps of
               power density and plots of small Hjorth electrical distances can
               be used to identify electrodes affected by electrolyte
               spreading. Interpolation using spherical splines offers a method

               particularly that concerning the location of active sources in
               the brain. Localizing the sources of a given scalp measurement
               is only achieved by solving the so-called inverse problem. By
               introducing reasonable a priori constraints, the inverse problem
               can be solved and the most probable sources in the brain at
               every moment in time can be accurately localized. METHODS AND
               RESULTS: Here, we review the different EEG source localization
               procedures applied during the last two decades. Additionally, we
               detail the importance of those procedures preceding and
               following source estimation that are intimately linked to a
               successful, reliable result. We discuss (1) the number and

               accuracy of epileptic source localization with high electrode
               density to that obtained with sparser electrode setups. Methods:
               Interictal epileptiform activity was recorded with 123
               electrodes in 14 epileptic patients undergoing presurgical
               evaluation. Each single epileptiform potential was down sampled
               to 63 and 31 electrodes, and a distributed source model
               (EPIFOCUS) was used to reconstruct the sources with the 3
               different electrode configurations. The localization accuracy
               with the 3 electrode setups was then assessed, by determining
               the distance from the inverse solution, maximum of each single
               spike to the epileptogenic lesion. Results: In 9/14 patients,
               the distance from the EEG source to the lesion was significantly
               smaller with 63 than with 31 electrodes, and increasing the

              adaptations that occur in response to a unilaterally applied leg
              load as subjects walked at their preferred walking speed. It was
              hypothesized that this adaptation would alter interlimb
              coordination while intralimb coordination remained invariant.
              Subjects (n = 12) were required to walk on a treadmill at
              preferred walking speed. Bilateral 3-D kinematic data were
              collected while a load placed on the leg was increased. Gait
              adaptations to leg-loading were assessed through changes in
              coordination patterns between specific limb couplings. Continuous
              relative phase (CRP) was used to evaluate changes in limb
              coordination under each experimental load condition compared to a
              no load baseline condition. Both changes in magnitude of CRP
              (root-mean-square (RMS) analysis) as well as temporal changes in
              CRP across the stride cycle (cross-correlation) were assessed.
              Cross-Correlation values changed with load for all interlimb
              couplings assessed suggesting alterations in interlimb
              coordination across the stride cycle. CRP cross-correlation
              values were close to 1.0 in all the intralimb couplings examined,
              showing a relative invariance in intralimb coordination.
              Coordination changes in RMS were also observed for the interlimb
              couplings. RMS changes were also observed in the intralimb
              couplings on the loaded side. It appears that gait adaptations to
              a unilaterally applied leg load appear both at the intralimb and
              interlimb level. However, the majority of changes did appear at
              the interlimb level, where CRP as assessed through both
              cross-correlation and RMS measures changed. This study supports
              previous results that suggested a tighter coupling exists at the
              intralimb level, leaving the majority of gait adaptations to
              occur at the interlimb level. The observed adaptation in
              differences between interlimb and intralimb coordination may
              provide insight into gait adaptations in pathological gait.",

  abstract = "Neuronal coupling between the arms and legs allowing coordinated
              rhythmic movement during locomotion is poorly understood. We used
              the modulation of cutaneous reflexes to probe this neuronal
              coupling between the arms and legs using a cycling paradigm.
              Participants performed rhythmic cycling with arms, legs, or arms
              and legs together. We hypothesized that any contributions from
              the arms would be functionally linked to locomotion and would
              thus be phase-dependent. Reflexes were evoked by electrical
              stimulation of the superficial peroneal nerve at the ankle, and
              electromyography (EMG) was recorded from muscles in the arms and
              legs. The main finding was that the relative contribution from
              the arms and legs was linked to the functional state of the legs.
              For example, in tibialis anterior, the largest contribution from
              arm movement [57\% variance accounted for (VAF), P < 0.05] was
              during the leg power phase, whereas the largest from leg movement
              (71\% VAF, P < 0.05) was during leg cycling recovery. Thus the
              contribution from the arms was functionally gated throughout the
              locomotor cycle in a manner that appears to support the action of
              the legs. Additionally, the effect of arm cycling on reflexes in
              leg muscles when the legs were not moving was relatively minor;
              full expression of the effect of rhythmic arm movement was only
              observed when both the arms and legs were moving. Our findings
              provide experimental support for the interaction of rhythmic arm
              and leg movement during human locomotion.",

  abstract = "Locomotion is incredibly flexible. Humans are able to stay
              upright and navigate long distances in the face of ever-changing
              environments and varied task demands, such as walking while
              carrying a heavy object or in thick mud. The focus of this review
              is a behavior that is critical for this flexibility: motor
              adaptation. Adaptation is defined here as the process of
              adjusting a movement to new demands through trial-and-error
              practice. A key feature of adaptation is that more practice
              without the new demand is required to return the movement to its
              original state. Thus, motor adaptation is a short-term motor
              learning process. Several studies have been undertaken to
              determine how humans adapt walking to novel circumstances. Many
              of these studies have examined locomotor adaptation using a
              split-belt treadmill. The results of these studies of people who
              were healthy and people with neurologic damage suggest that the
              cerebellum is required for normal adaptation of walking and that
              the role of cerebral structures may be less critical. They also
              suggest that intersegmental and interlimb coordination is
              critical but readily adaptable to accommodate changes in the
              environment. Locomotor adaptation also can be used to determine
              the walking potential of people with specific neurologic
              deficits. For instance, split-belt and limb-weighting locomotor
              adaptation studies show that adults with chronic stroke are
              capable of improving weight-bearing and spatiotemporal symmetry,
              at least temporarily. Our challenge as rehabilitation specialists
              is to intervene in ways that maximize this capacity.",

  author   = "Raasch, C C and Zajac, F E",
  abstract = "A group of coexcited muscles alternating with another group is a
              common element of motor control, including locomotor pattern
              generation. This study used computer simulation to investigate
              human pedaling with each muscle assigned at times to a group.
              Simulations were generated by applying patterns of muscle
              excitations to a musculoskeletal model that includes the dynamic
              properties of the muscles, the limb segments, and the crank load.
              Raasch et al. showed that electromyograms, pedal reaction forces,
              and limb and crank kinematics recorded during maximum-speed
              start-up pedaling could be replicated with two signals
              controlling the excitation of four muscle groups (1 group
              alternating with another to form a pair). Here a
              four-muscle-group control also is shown to replicate steady
              pedaling. However, simulations show that three signals
              controlling six muscle groups (i.e., 3 pairs) is much more
              biomechanically robust, such that a wide variety of forward and
              backward pedaling tasks can be executed well. We found the
              biomechanical functions necessary for pedaling, and how these
              functions can be executed by the muscle groups. Specifically, the
              phasing of two pairs with respect to limb extension and flexion
              and the transitions between extension and flexion do not change
              with pedaling direction. One pair of groups (uniarticular hip and
              knee extensors alternating with their anatomic antagonists)
              generates the energy required for limb and crank propulsion
              during limb extension and flexion, respectively. In the second
              pair, the ankle plantarflexors transfer the energy from the limb
              inertia to the crank during the latter part of limb extension and
              the subsequent limb extension-to-flexion transition. The
              dorsiflexors alternate with the plantarflexors. The phasing of
              the third pair (the biarticular thigh muscles) reverses with
              pedaling direction. In forward pedaling, the hamstring is excited
              during the extension-to-flexion transition and in backward
              pedaling during the opposite transition. In both cases hamstrings
              propel the crank posteriorly through the transition. Rectus
              femoris alternates with hamstrings and propels the crank
              anteriorly through the transitions. With three control signals,
              one for each pair of groups, different cadences (or power
              outputs) can be achieved by adjusting the overall excitatory
              drive to the pattern generating elements, and different pedaling
              goals (e.g., smooth, or energy-efficient pedaling; 1- or 2-legged
              pedaling) by adjusting the relative excitation levels among the
              muscle groups. These six muscle groups are suggested to be
              elements of a general strategy for pedaling control, which may be
              generally applicable to other human locomotor tasks.",

  abstract  = "Interlimb coordination is critically important during bipedal
               locomotion and often must be adapted to account for varying
               environmental circumstances. Here we studied adaptation of human
               interlimb coordination using a split-belt treadmill, where the
               legs can be made to move at different speeds. Human adults,
               infants, and spinal cats can alter walking patterns on a
               split-belt treadmill by prolonging stance and shortening swing
               on the slower limb and vice versa on the faster limb. It is not
               known whether other locomotor parameters change or if there is a
               capacity for storage of a new motor pattern after training. We
               asked whether adults adapt both intra- and interlimb gait
               parameters during split-belt walking and show aftereffects from
               training. Healthy subjects were tested walking with belts tied
               (baseline), then belts split (adaptation), and again tied
               (postadaptation). Walking parameters that directly relate to the
               interlimb relationship changed slowly during adaptation and
               showed robust aftereffects during postadaptation. These changes
               paralleled subjective impressions of limping versus no limping.
               In contrast, parameters calculated from an individual leg
               changed rapidly to accommodate split-belts and showed no
               aftereffects. These results suggest some independence of neural
               control of intra- versus interlimb parameters during walking.
               They also show that the adult nervous system can adapt and store
               new interlimb patterns after short bouts of training. The
               differences in intra- versus interlimb control may be related to
               the varying complexity of the parameters, task demands, and/or
               the level of neural control necessary for their adaptation.",

              Zajac, F E",
  abstract = "The objective of this study was to determine if independent
              central pattern generating elements controlling the legs in
              bipedal and unipedal locomotion is a viable theory for locomotor
              propulsion in humans. Coordinative coupling of the limbs could
              then be accomplished through mechanical interactions and
              ipsilateral feedback control rather than through central
              interlimb neural pathways. Pedaling was chosen as the locomotor
              task to study because interlimb mechanics can be significantly
              altered, as pedaling can be executed with the use of either one
              leg or two legs (cf. walking) and because the load on the limb
              can be well-controlled. Subjects pedaled a modified bicycle
              ergometer in a two-legged (bilateral) and a one-legged
              (unilateral) pedaling condition. The loading on the leg during
              unilateral pedaling was designed to be identical to the loading
              experienced by the leg during bilateral pedaling. This loading
              was achieved by having a trained human ``motor'' pedal along with
              the subject and exert on the opposite crank the torque that the
              subject's contralateral leg generated in bilateral pedaling. The
              human ``motor'' was successful at reproducing each subject's
              one-leg crank torque. The shape of the motor's torque trajectory
              was similar to that of subjects, and the amount of work done
              during extension and flexion was not significantly different.
              Thus the same muscle coordination pattern would allow subjects to
              pedal successfully in both the bilateral and unilateral
              conditions, and the afferent signals from the pedaling leg could
              be the same for both conditions. Although the overall work done
              by each leg did not change, an 86\% decrease in retarding
              (negative) crank torque during limb flexion was measured in all
              11 subjects during the unilateral condition. This corresponded to
              an increase in integrated electromyography of tibialis anterior
              (70\%), rectus femoris (43\%), and biceps femoris (59\%) during
              flexion. Even given visual torque feedback in the unilateral
              condition, subjects still showed a 33\% decrease in negative
              torque during flexion. These results are consistent with the
              existence of an inhibitory pathway from elements controlling
              extension onto contralateral flexion elements, with the pathway
              operating during two-legged pedaling but not during one-legged
              pedaling, in which case flexor activity increases. However, this
              centrally mediated coupling can be overcome with practice, as the
              human ``motor'' was able to effectively match the bilateral crank
              torque after a longer practice regimen. We conclude that the
              sensorimotor control of a unipedal task is affected by interlimb
              neural pathways. Thus a task performed unilaterally is not
              performed with the same muscle coordination utilized in a bipedal
              condition, even if such coordination would be equally effective
              in the execution of the unilateral task.",

  abstract = "Following stroke, hemiparesis results in impaired motor control.
              Specifically, inappropriate direction of foot-forces during
              locomotion has been reported. In our previous study (Liang and
              Brown 2011) that examined poststroke foot-force direction during
              a seated, supported locomotor task, we observed that foot-force
              control capabilities were preserved poststroke. In this current
              study, we sought to better understand the mechanisms underlying
              the interaction of locomotor and postural control as an
              interactive mechanism that might interfere, poststroke, with
              appropriate foot-force generation. We designed an experiment in
              which participants performed biomechanically controlled locomotor
              tasks, under posturally challenged pedaling conditions while they
              generated mechanical output that was comparable to pedaling
              conditions without postural challenge, thus allowing us to
              monitor the strategies that the nervous system adopts when
              postural conditions were manipulated. We hypothesized that, with
              postural influence, individuals poststroke would generate
              inappropriate shear forces accompanied by inappropriate changes
              to muscle activity patterns when performing a mechanically
              controlled locomotor task, and would be exaggerated with
              increased postural loading. Sixteen individuals with chronic
              poststroke hemiparesis and 14 age-similar nonimpaired controls
              pedaled on a cycle ergometer under 1) seated supported and 2)
              nonseated postural loaded pedaling conditions, generating matched
              pedal force outputs of two effort levels. When we compared
              postural influence with seated pedaling, we observed increased
              magnitudes of forward-directed shear forces in the paretic legs
              associated with increased magnitude of leg extensor muscle
              activity, but not in controls. These findings provide evidence to
              support a model that describes independent controllers for
              posture and locomotion, but that the interaction between the two
              controllers is impaired poststroke.",

              of Parkinson's disease (PD), which significantly affects
              patients' quality of life. Treatment options offer limited
              benefit and there are currently no mechanisms able to effectively
              detect FOG before it occurs, allowing time for a sufferer to
              avert a freezing episode. Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a
              novel technique that may be able to address this problem. In this
              paper, we investigated the univariate and multivariate EEG
              features determined by both Fourier and wavelet analysis in the
              confirmation and prediction of FOG. The EEG power measures and
              network properties from 16 patients with PD and FOG were
              extracted and analyzed. It was found that both power spectral
              density and wavelet energy could potentially act as biomarkers
              during FOG. Information in the frequency domain of the EEG was
              found to provide better discrimination of EEG signals during
              transition to freezing than information coded in the time domain.
              The performance of the FOG prediction systems improved when the
              information from both domains was used. This combination resulted
              in a sensitivity of 86.0\%, specificity of 74.4\%, and accuracy

               network activity supporting the fluidity of human cognition and
               behavior. This non-stationarity may involve ever-changing
               formation and dissolution of active cortical sources and brain
               networks. However, unsupervised approaches to identify and model
               these changes in brain dynamics as continuous transitions
               between quasi-stable brain states using unlabeled, noninvasive
               recordings of brain activity have been limited. This study
               explores the use of adaptive mixture independent component
               analysis (AMICA) to model multichannel electroencephalographic
               (EEG) data with a set of ICA models, each of which decomposes an
               adaptively learned portion of the data into statistically
               independent sources. We first show that AMICA can segment
               simulated quasi-stationary EEG data and accurately identify
               ground-truth sources and source model transitions. Next, we
               demonstrate that AMICA decomposition, applied to 6-13 channel
               scalp recordings from the CAP Sleep Database, can characterize
               sleep stage dynamics, allowing 75\% accuracy in identifying
               transitions between six sleep stages without use of EEG power
               spectra. Finally, applied to 30-channel data from subjects in a
               driving simulator, AMICA identifies models that account for EEG
               during faster and slower response to driving challenges,
               respectively. We show changes in relative probabilities of these
               models allow effective prediction of subject response speed and
               moment-by-moment characterization of state changes within single
               trials. AMICA thus provides a generic unsupervised approach to
               identifying and modeling changes in EEG dynamics. Applied to
               continuous, unlabeled multichannel data, AMICA may likely be
               used to detect and study any changes in cognitive states.",

               understanding the neural mechanisms of upper-limb reaching
               control. This study specifically addressed how EEG dynamics in

               tuning) and posture dependence (movement reference frames) by
               applying representational similarity analysis. High-density EEG
               covering the entire scalp was recorded while participants
               performed eight-directional, center-out reaching movements,
               thereby allowing us to explore directional selectivity of EEG
               sources over the brain beyond somatosensory areas. A majority of
               the source processes exhibited statistically significant
               directional tuning during peri-movement periods. In addition,
               directional tuning curves shifted systematically when the

  abstract = "Characterizing locomotor dynamics is essential for understanding
              the neuromuscular control of locomotion. In particular,
              quantifying dynamic stability during walking is important for
              assessing people who have a greater risk of falling. However,
              traditional biomechanical methods of defining stability have not
              quantified the resistance of the neuromuscular system to
              perturbations, suggesting that more precise definitions are
              required. For the present study, average maximum finite-time
              Lyapunov exponents were estimated to quantify the local dynamic
              stability of human walking kinematics. Local scaling exponents,
              defined as the local slopes of the correlation sum curves, were
              also calculated to quantify the local scaling structure of each
              embedded time series. Comparisons were made between overground
              and motorized treadmill walking in young healthy subjects and
              between diabetic neuropathic (NP) patients and healthy controls
              (CO) during overground walking. A modification of the method of
              surrogate data was developed to examine the stochastic nature of
              the fluctuations overlying the nominally periodic patterns in
              these data sets. Results demonstrated that having subjects walk
              on a motorized treadmill artificially stabilized their natural
              locomotor kinematics by small but statistically significant
              amounts. Furthermore, a paradox previously present in the
              biomechanical literature that resulted from mistakenly equating
              variability with dynamic stability was resolved. By slowing their
              self-selected walking speeds, NP patients adopted more locally
              stable gait patterns, even though they simultaneously exhibited
              greater kinematic variability than CO subjects. Additionally, the
              loss of peripheral sensation in NP patients was associated with
              statistically significant differences in the local scaling
              structure of their walking kinematics at those length scales
              where it was anticipated that sensory feedback would play the
              greatest role. Lastly, stride-to-stride fluctuations in the
              walking patterns of all three subject groups were clearly
              distinguishable from linearly autocorrelated Gaussian noise. As a
              collateral benefit of the methodological approach taken in this
              study, some of the first steps at characterizing the underlying
              structure of human locomotor dynamics have been taken.

              maintain the stability of standing and walking should be quite
              different. However, many studies have shown that postural

              standing and walking. The present study was conducted to
              determine whether the postural stability either is or is not
              directly related to locomotor stability. Twenty healthy adults,
              age 18-73 years, walked on a motorized treadmill at their
              preferred walking speed for three trials of 5 min. They also
              stood on a force plate for three trials of 5 min. Both tasks were
              performed without imposing any additional external perturbations.
              The motion of each subject's trunk segment was recorded and
              described using a multi-dimensional state space defined in the
              same manner for both tasks. Local dynamic stability was

              perturbed trajectories in state space, which was parameterized as
              a double exponential process. Divergence parameters were compared

              COP measures were significantly correlated to local divergence
              parameters for standing, but not to those for walking. This study
              provides direct evidence that the mechanisms governing standing

  abstract = "Variability is ubiquitous in human movement, arising from
              internal and external noise, inherent biological redundancy, and
              from the neurophysiological control actions that help regulate
              movement fluctuations. Increased walking variability can lead to
              increased energetic cost and/or increased fall risk. Conversely,
              biological noise may be beneficial, even necessary, to enhance
              motor performance. Indeed, encouraging more variability actually
              facilitates greater improvements in some forms of locomotor
              rehabilitation. Thus, it is critical to identify the fundamental
              principles humans use to regulate stride-to-stride fluctuations
              in walking. This study sought to determine how humans regulate
              stride-to-stride fluctuations in stepping movements during
              treadmill walking. We developed computational models based on
              pre-defined goal functions to compare if subjects, from each
              stride to the next, tried to maintain the same speed as the
              treadmill, or instead stay in the same position on the treadmill.
              Both strategies predicted average behaviors empirically
              indistinguishable from each other and from that of humans. These
              strategies, however, predicted very different stride-to-stride
              fluctuation dynamics. Comparisons to experimental data showed
              that human stepping movements were generally well-predicted by
              the speed-control model, but not by the position-control model.
              Human subjects also exhibited no indications they corrected
              deviations in absolute position only intermittently: i.e., closer
              to the boundaries of the treadmill. Thus, humans clearly do not
              adopt a control strategy whose primary goal is to maintain some
              constant absolute position on the treadmill. Instead, humans
              appear to regulate their stepping movements in a way most
              consistent with a strategy whose primary goal is to try to
              maintain the same speed as the treadmill at each consecutive
              stride. These findings have important implications both for
              understanding how biological systems regulate walking in general
              and for being able to harness these mechanisms to develop more
              effective rehabilitation interventions to improve locomotor
              performance.",

              limb amputation report a fear of falling and fall at least once a
              year. Perturbation-based gait training and the use of virtual
              environments have been shown independently to be effective at
              improving walking stability in patient populations. An
              intervention was developed combining the strengths of the 2
              paradigms utilizing continuous, walking surface angle
              oscillations within a virtual environment. This case report
              describes walking function and mediolateral stability outcomes of
              an individual with a unilateral transfemoral amputation following
              a novel perturbation-based gait training intervention in a
              virtual environment. CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient was a
              43-year-old male veteran who underwent a right transfemoral
              amputation 7+ years previously as a result of a traumatic blast
              injury. He used a microprocessor-controlled knee and an energy
              storage and return foot. OUTCOMES: Following the intervention,
              multiple measures indicated improved function and stability,
              including faster self-selected walking speed and reduced
              functional stepping time, mean step width, and step width
              variability. These changes were seen during normal level walking
              and mediolateral visual field or platform perturbations. In
              addition, benefits were retained at least 5 weeks after the final
              training session. DISCUSSION: The perturbation-based gait
              training program in the virtual environment resulted in the
              patient's improved walking function and mediolateral stability.
              Although the patient had completed intensive rehabilitation
              following injury and was fully independent, the intervention
              still induced notable improvements to mediolateral stability.
              Thus, perturbation-based gait training in challenging simulated
              environments shows promise for improving walking stability and
              may be beneficial when integrated into a rehabilitation program.",

  abstract = "Humans use visual optic flow to regulate average walking speed.
              Among many possible strategies available, healthy humans walking
              on motorized treadmills allow fluctuations in stride length (Ln)
              and stride time (Tn) to persist across multiple consecutive
              strides, but rapidly correct deviations in stride speed
              (Sn=Ln/Tn) at each successive stride, n. Several experiments
              verified this stepping strategy when participants walked with no
              optic flow. This study determined how removing or systematically
              altering optic flow influenced peoples' stride-to-stride stepping
              control strategies. Participants walked on a treadmill with a
              virtual reality (VR) scene projected onto a 3m tall, 180°
              semi-cylindrical screen in front of the treadmill. Five
              conditions were tested: blank screen (``BLANK''), static scene
              (``STATIC''), or moving scene with optic flow speed slower than
              (``SLOW''), matched to (``MATCH''), or faster than (``FAST'')
              walking speed. Participants took shorter and faster strides and
              demonstrated increased stepping variability during the BLANK
              condition compared to the other conditions. Thus, when visual
              information was removed, individuals appeared to walk more
              cautiously. Optic flow influenced both how quickly humans
              corrected stride speed deviations and how successful they were at
              enacting this strategy to try to maintain approximately constant
              speed at each stride. These results were consistent with Weber's
              law: healthy adults more-rapidly corrected stride speed
              deviations in a no optic flow condition (the lower intensity
              stimuli) compared to contexts with non-zero optic flow. These
              results demonstrate how the temporal characteristics of optic
              flow influence ability to correct speed fluctuations during
              walking.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: A prevailing paradigm of physical rehabilitation
              following neurologic injury is to ``assist-as-needed'' in
              completing desired movements. Several research groups are
              attempting to automate this principle with robotic movement
              training devices and patient cooperative algorithms that
              encourage voluntary participation. These attempts are currently
              not based on computational models of motor learning. METHODS:
              Here we assume that motor recovery from a neurologic injury can
              be modelled as a process of learning a novel sensory motor
              transformation, which allows us to study a simplified
              experimental protocol amenable to mathematical description.
              Specifically, we use a robotic force field paradigm to impose a
              virtual impairment on the left leg of unimpaired subjects walking
              on a treadmill. We then derive an ``assist-as-needed'' robotic
              training algorithm to help subjects overcome the virtual
              impairment and walk normally. The problem is posed as an
              optimization of performance error and robotic assistance. The
              optimal robotic movement trainer becomes an error-based
              controller with a forgetting factor that bounds kinematic errors
              while systematically reducing its assistance when those errors
              are small. As humans have a natural range of movement
              variability, we introduce an error weighting function that causes
              the robotic trainer to disregard this variability. RESULTS: We
              experimentally validated the controller with ten unimpaired
              subjects by demonstrating how it helped the subjects learn the
              novel sensory motor transformation necessary to counteract the
              virtual impairment, while also preventing them from experiencing
              large kinematic errors. The addition of the error weighting
              function allowed the robot assistance to fade to zero even though
              the subjects' movements were variable. We also show that in order
              to assist-as-needed, the robot must relax its assistance at a
              rate faster than that of the learning human. CONCLUSION: The
              assist-as-needed algorithm proposed here can limit error during
              the learning of a dynamic motor task. The algorithm encourages
              learning by decreasing its assistance as a function of the
              ongoing progression of movement error. This type of algorithm is
              well suited for helping people learn dynamic tasks for which
              large kinematic errors are dangerous or discouraging, and thus
              may prove useful for robot-assisted movement training of walking
              or reaching following neurologic injury.",

              as a process in which the motor system greedily minimizes a cost
              function that is the weighted sum of kinematic error and effort.
              The learning dynamics predicted by this minimization process are
              a linear, auto-regressive equation with only one state, which has
              been identified previously as providing a good fit to data from
              force-field-type experiments. Thus we provide a new theoretical
              result that shows how these previously identified learning
              dynamics can be viewed as arising from an optimization of error
              and effort. We also show that the coefficients of the learning

  abstract = "At present, rhythmic and discrete movements are investigated by
              largely distinct research communities using different
              experimental paradigms and theoretical constructs. As these two
              classes of movements are tightly interlinked in everyday
              behavior, a common theoretical foundation spanning across these
              two types of movements would be valuable. Furthermore, it has
              been argued that these two movement types may constitute
              primitives for more complex behavior. The goal of this paper is
              to develop a rigorous taxonomic foundation that not only permits
              better communication between different research communities, but
              also helps in defining movement types in experimental design and
              thereby clarifies fundamental questions about primitives in motor
              control. We propose formal definitions for discrete and rhythmic
              movements, analyze some of their variants, and discuss the
              application of a smoothness measure to both types that enables
              quantification of discreteness and rhythmicity. Central to the
              definition of discrete movement is their separation by postures.
              Based on this intuitive definition, certain variants of rhythmic
              movement are indistinguishable from a sequence of discrete
              movements, reflecting an ongoing debate in the motor neuroscience
              literature. Conversely, there exist rhythmic movements that
              cannot be composed of a sequence of discrete movements. As such,
              this taxonomy may provide a language for studying more complex
              behaviors in a principled fashion.",

  abstract = "It has been proposed that different forms of rhythmic human limb
              movement have a common central neural control ('common core
              hypothesis'), just as in other animals. We compared the
              modulation patterns of background EMG and cutaneous reflexes
              during walking, arm and leg cycling, and arm-assisted recumbent
              stepping. We hypothesized that patterns of EMG and reflex
              modulation during cycling and stepping (deduced from mathematical
              principal components analysis) would be comparable to those
              during walking because they rely on similar neural substrates.
              Differences between the tasks were assessed by evoking cutaneous
              reflexes via stimulation of nerves in the foot and hand in
              separate trials. The EMG was recorded from flexor and extensor
              muscles of the arms and legs. Angular positions of the hip, knee
              and elbow joints were also recorded. Factor analysis revealed
              that across the three tasks, four principal components explained
              more than 93\% of the variance in the background EMG and
              middle-latency reflex amplitude. Phase modulation of reflex
              amplitude was observed in most muscles across all tasks,
              suggesting activity in similar control networks. Significant
              correlations between EMG level and reflex amplitude were
              frequently observed only during static voluntary muscle
              activation and not during rhythmic movement. Results from a
              control experiment showed that strong correlation between EMG and
              reflex amplitudes was observed during discrete, voluntary leg
              extension but not during walking. There were task-dependent
              differences in reflex modulation between the three tasks which
              probably arise owing to specific constraints during each task.
              Overall, the results show strong correlation across tasks and
              support common neural patterning as the regulator of arm and leg
              movement during various rhythmic human movements.",

  abstract = "It is well established that the sensorimotor state of one limb

              inputs make an important contribution to interlimb coordination
              patterns. However, the relative contribution of interlimb
              pathways for modifying muscle activation patterns in terms of
              phasing is less clear. Here we studied adaptation of muscle
              activity phasing to the relative angular positions of limbs using
              a split-crank ergometer, where the cranks could be decoupled to
              allow different spatial angular position relationships. Twenty
              neurologically healthy individuals performed the specified
              pedaling tasks at different relative angular positions while
              surface electromyographic (EMG) signals were recorded bilaterally
              from eight lower extremity muscles. During each experiment, the
              relative angular crank positions were altered by increasing or
              decreasing their difference by randomly ordered increments of 30
              degrees over the complete cycle [0 degrees (in phase pedaling);
              30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 degrees (standard pedaling); and

              found that manipulating the relative angular positions of limbs
              in a pedaling task caused muscle activity phasing changes that
              were either delayed or advanced, dependent on the relative
              spatial position of the two cranks and this relationship is
              well-explained by a sine curve. Further, we observed that the
              magnitude of phasing changes in biarticular muscles (like rectus
              femoris) was significantly greater than those of uniarticular
              muscles (like vastus medialis). These results are important
              because they provide new evidence that muscle phasing can be
              systematically influenced by interlimb pathways.",

  abstract = "After stroke, hemiparesis will result in impairments to locomotor
              control. Specifically, muscle coordination deficits, in the form
              of inappropriately phased muscle-activity patterns, occur in both
              the paretic and nonparetic limbs. These dysfunctional paretic
              muscle-coordination patterns can adapt to somatosensory inputs,
              and also the sensorimotor state of nonparetic limb can influence
              paretic limb. However, the relative contribution of interlimb
              pathways for improving paretic muscle-activation patterns in
              terms of phasing remains unknown. In this study, we investigated
              whether the paretic muscle-activity phasing can be influenced by
              the relative angular-spatial relationship of the nonparetic limb
              by using a split-crank ergometer, where the cranks could be
              decoupled. Eighteen participants with chronic stroke were asked

              extremity muscles (vastus medialis, rectus femoris, tibialis
              anterior, and soleus). During each experiment, the relative
              angular crank positions were manipulated by increasing or

              nonparetic muscle phasing in the cycle systematically adapted to
              varied relative angular relationships, and this systematic
              relationship was well modeled by a sinusoidal relationship. Also,
              the paretic uniarticular muscle (vastus medialis) showed larger
              phase shifts compared with biarticular muscle (rectus femoris).
              More importantly, for each stroke subject, we demonstrated an
              exclusive crank-angular relation that resulted in the generation
              of more appropriately phased paretic muscle activity. These

              were instructed to step with 1) mechanically coupled vs.
              decoupled arm and leg movements, 2) synchronous vs. asynchronous
              arm movements, and 3) at 50 vs. 70 RPM. Leg muscle activity was
              increased by active arm movements in all muscles, except the
              vastus lateralis muscle. Activity of other extensors (soleus,

              Facilitation was more or less consistent for both frequencies and

              robotic technology that delivers augmented error signals during
              training, in participants with stroke. METHODS: A total of 26
              participants with chronic hemiparesis were trained with haptic
              (via robot-rendered forces) and graphic (via a virtual
              environment) distortions to amplify upper-extremity (UE) tracking
              error. In a randomized crossover design, the intervention was
              compared with an equivalent amount of practice without error
              augmentation (EA). Interventions involved three 45-minute
              sessions per week for 2 weeks, then 1 week of no treatment, and
              then 2 additional weeks of the alternate treatment. A therapist
              provided a visual cursor using a tracking device, and
              participants were instructed to match it with their hand. Haptic
              and visual EA was used with blinding of participant, therapist,
              technician-operator, and evaluator. Clinical measures of
              impairment were obtained at the beginning and end of each 2-week
              treatment phase as well as at 1 week and at 45 days after the
              last treatment. RESULTS: Outcomes showed a small, but significant
              benefit to EA training over simple repetitive practice, with a
              mean 2-week improvement in Fugl-Meyer UE motor score of 2.08 and

              This interactive technology may improve UE motor recovery of

              maintaining independence with advancing age. Age-related
              sensorimotor changes and increased muscle coactivation likely
              alter the trial-and-error-based process of adapting to new
              movement demands (motor adaptation). Here, we asked, to what
              extent is motor adaptation to novel dynamics maintained in older
              adults ($\geq$65 yr)? We hypothesized that older adults would
              adapt to the novel dynamics less well than young adults. Because
              older adults often use muscle coactivation, we expected older
              adults to use greater muscle coactivation during motor adaptation
              than young adults. Nevertheless, we predicted that older adults
              would reduce muscle activity and metabolic cost with motor
              adaptation, similar to young adults. Seated older (n = 11, 73.8
              $\pm$ 5.6 yr) and young (n = 15, 23.8 $\pm$ 4.7 yr) adults made
              targeted reaching movements while grasping a robotic arm. We
              measured their metabolic rate continuously via expired gas
              analysis. A force field was used to add novel dynamics. Older
              adults had greater movement deviations and compensated for just
              65\% of the novel dynamics compared with 84\% in young adults. As
              expected, older adults used greater muscle coactivation than
              young adults. Last, older adults reduced muscle activity with
              motor adaptation and had consistent reductions in metabolic cost
              later during motor adaptation, similar to young adults. These
              results suggest that despite increased muscle coactivation, older
              adults can adapt to the novel dynamics, albeit less accurately.
              These results also suggest that reductions in metabolic cost may
              be a fundamental feature of motor adaptation.",

              variety of objects in various conditions on a daily basis.
              Evidence suggests that motor adaptation relies on a process that
              minimizes error and effort; however, much of this evidence
              involved adapting to novel dynamics with physical perturbations
              to counteract. To examine the generality of the process of
              minimizing error and effort during motor adaptation, we used a
              visuomotor adaptation task that did not involve dynamic
              perturbations. We investigated the time courses of muscle
              activity, coactivation, and metabolic cost as subjects reached to
              a target with a visuomotor rotation. We wanted to determine
              whether subjects would modulate muscle activity, coactivation,
              and metabolic cost during a visuomotor adaptation task.
              Interestingly, subjects increased muscle coactivation early
              during visuomotor adaptation when there were large
              cursor-trajectory errors but no physical perturbations to reject.
              As adaptation progressed, muscle activity and coactivation
              decreased. Metabolic cost followed a similar time course. When
              the perturbation was removed, typical after-effects were
              observed: trajectory error increased and then was reduced
              quickly. This was accompanied by increases in muscle activity,
              coactivation, and metabolic cost, along with subsequent rapid
              reductions. These results demonstrate that subjects modulate
              muscle activity, coactivation, and metabolic cost similarly
              across different forms of motor adaptation. Overall, our findings
              suggest that minimization of error and effort may be a general
              process underlying various forms of motor adaptation.",

              of the limbs and under various conditions of the motor task.
              Antiphase active arm movements were characterized by higher
              muscle activity than during the inphase mode. The muscle activity
              during passive arm movements imposed by the experimentalist was
              significantly lower than muscle activity during passive arm
              movements imposed by the other arm. When loading one arm, the
              muscle activity in the other, passively moving, arm increased
              independently from the synergy of arm movements. During a motor

              considered automatic, such that any perturbations are corrected
              for, even if the perturbation was not consciously noted. Temporal
              correction of upper limb (e.g., finger tapping) and lower limb
              (e.g., stepping) movements to a phase perturbed auditory beat
              usually results in individuals being back in phase after just a
              few beats. When a metronome is presented in more than one sensory
              modality, a multisensory advantage is observed, with reduced
              temporal variability in finger tapping movements compared to
              unimodal conditions. Here, we investigate synchronization of
              lower limb movements (stepping in place) to auditory, visual and
              combined auditory-visual (AV) metronome cues. In addition, we

              perturbations in the metronome for the three sensory modality
              conditions. We hypothesized that, as with upper limb movements,
              there would be a multisensory advantage, with stepping
              variability being lowest in the bimodal condition. As such, we
              further expected correction to the phase perturbation to be
              quickest in the bimodal condition. Our results revealed lower
              variability in the asynchronies between foot strikes and the
              metronome beats in the bimodal condition, compared to unimodal
              conditions. However, while participants corrected substantially
              quicker to perturbations in auditory compared to visual
              metronomes, there was no multisensory advantage in the phase
              correction task-correction under the bimodal condition was almost
              identical to the auditory-only (AO) condition. On the whole, we
              noted that corrections in the stepping task were smaller than
              those previously reported for finger tapping studies. We conclude
              that temporal corrections are not only affected by the
              reliability of the sensory information, but also the complexity
              of the movement itself.",

              became relatively skilled at putting to a near and far target by
              first practicing without force fields. On day 2, they warmed up
              at the task without force fields, then practiced with force
              fields that either reduced or augmented their kinematic errors

              motivational effects persisted on day 3 in a way that was

              that yield the greatest success. Here, we investigated the role
              of the human basal ganglia in controlling reward-dependent motor
              variability as measured by trial-to-trial changes in performance
              during a reaching task. We designed an experiment in which the

              probability of reward. In healthy controls, reach variability
              increased as the probability of reward decreased. Control of
              variability depended on the history of past rewards, with the

              after rewarded trials, reach variability in the patients was
              comparable to healthy controls. In summary, we found that
              movement variability is partially a form of exploration driven by
              the recent history of rewards. When the function of the human
              basal ganglia is compromised, the reward-dependent control of
              movement variability is impaired, particularly affecting the
              ability to increase variability after unsuccessful outcomes.",

              position during standing or walking, and perception of contact
              force during stepping. Our results show that split-belt
              adaptation leads to robust motor aftereffects and alters the
              perception of leg speed during walking. This is specific to the
              direction of walking that was trained during adaptation (i.e.,
              backward or forward). The change in leg speed perception accounts
              for roughly half of the observed motor aftereffect. In contrast,
              split-belt adaptation does not alter the perception of leg
              position during standing or walking and does not change the
              perception of stepping force. Our results demonstrate that there
              is a recalibration of a sensory percept specific to the domain of
              the perturbation that was applied during walking (i.e., speed but
              not position or force). Furthermore, the motor and sensory
              consequences of locomotor adaptation may be linked, suggesting
              overlapping mechanisms driving changes in the motor and sensory
              domains.",

  abstract = "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review examines recent brain imaging
              studies that might contribute to delivering better recovery of
              motor function after stroke. RECENT FINDINGS: Most recent studies
              characterize differences in structural and functional
              organization of the poststroke brain in relation to impairment,
              or measure alterations in brain organization as the result of one
              form of therapy or another. These studies have not altered
              clinical practice. New approaches can test specific models of
              motor recovery after stroke. Firstly, anatomical assessment of
              key motor pathways, particularly corticospinal tract, may be
              useful in predicting long-term outcomes if used in combination
              with early clinical scores. Secondly, assessment of neuronal
              oscillations with electro or magneto-encephalography may provide
              a novel way of assessing the balance between excitatory and
              inhibitory cortical processes and thereby provide biomarkers of
              the potential for experience-dependent plasticity. SUMMARY: Most
              recent studies are observational and do not test a plausible
              model of motor recovery after stroke. Brain imaging studies of
              stroke recovery need to consider how to provide tools to aid
              prediction of long-term outcome or response to treatment, or
              describe potential therapeutic targets for novel recovery
              promoting interventions, if they are to be clinically useful.",

  abstract = "Recent reports indicate that rhythmic and discrete upper-limb
              movements are two different motor primitives which recruit, at
              least partially, distinct neural circuitries. In particular,
              rhythmic movements recruit a smaller cortical network than
              discrete movements. The goal of this paper is to compare the
              levels of disability in performing rhythmic and discrete
              movements after a stroke. More precisely, we tested the
              hypothesis that rhythmic movements should be less affected than
              discrete ones, because they recruit neural circuitries that are
              less likely to be damaged by the stroke. Eleven stroke patients
              and eleven age-matched control subjects performed discrete and
              rhythmic movements using an end-effector robot (REAplan). The
              rhythmic movement condition was performed with and without visual
              targets to further decrease cortical recruitment. Movement
              kinematics was analyzed through specific metrics, capturing the
              degree of smoothness and harmonicity. We reported three main
              observations: (1) the movement smoothness of the paretic arm was
              more severely degraded for discrete movements than rhythmic
              movements; (2) most of the patients performed rhythmic movements
              with a lower harmonicity than controls; and (3) visually guided
              rhythmic movements were more altered than non-visually guided
              rhythmic movements. These results suggest a hierarchy in the
              levels of impairment: Discrete movements are more affected than
              rhythmic ones, which are more affected if they are visually
              guided. These results are a new illustration that discrete and
              rhythmic movements are two fundamental primitives in upper-limb
              movements. Moreover, this hierarchy of impairment opens new
              post-stroke rehabilitation perspectives.",

  abstract = "Although bicycling and walking involve similar complex
              coordinated movements, surprisingly Parkinson's patients with
              freezing of gait typically remain able to bicycle despite severe
              difficulties in walking. This observation suggests functional
              differences in the motor networks subserving bicycling and
              walking. However, a direct comparison of brain activity related
              to bicycling and walking has never been performed, neither in
              healthy participants nor in patients. Such a comparison could
              potentially help elucidating the cortical involvement in motor
              control and the mechanisms through which bicycling ability may be
              preserved in patients with freezing of gait. The aim of this
              study was to contrast the cortical oscillatory dynamics involved
              in bicycling and walking in healthy participants. To this end,
              EEG and EMG data of 14 healthy participants were analyzed, who
              cycled on a stationary bicycle at a slow cadence of 40
              revolutions per minute (rpm) and walked at 40 strides per minute
              (spm), respectively. Relative to walking, bicycling was
              associated with a stronger power decrease in the high beta band
              (23-35 Hz) during movement initiation and execution, followed by
              a stronger beta power increase after movement termination.
              Walking, on the other hand, was characterized by a stronger and
              persisting alpha power (8-12 Hz) decrease. Both bicycling and
              walking exhibited movement cycle-dependent power modulation in
              the 24-40 Hz range that was correlated with EMG activity. This
              modulation was significantly stronger in walking. The present
              findings reveal differential cortical oscillatory dynamics in
              motor control for two types of complex coordinated motor
              behavior, i.e., bicycling and walking. Bicycling was associated
              with a stronger sustained cortical activation as indicated by the
              stronger high beta power decrease during movement execution and
              less cortical motor control within the movement cycle. We
              speculate this to be due to the more continuous nature of
              bicycling demanding less phase-dependent sensory processing and
              motor planning, as opposed to walking.",

              and target-related sensory signals to encode a motor goal.
              Surprisingly, many of these regions show sustained activity
              during reach preparation even when target location is not
              specified, i.e., when a motor goal cannot be unambiguously

              without knowledge of target location was associated with a
              significant BOLD response bilaterally in the parietal cortex.
              Furthermore, EEG alpha- and beta-band activity was restricted to
              parietal scalp sites, the magnitude of the latter being

              require minimal central supervision. However, advantages for
              control may be offset by compromised versatility. Extending
              recent results showing that humans could not sustain discrete
              movements as duration decreased, this study tested whether
              smoothly rhythmic movements could be maintained as duration
              increased. Participants performed horizontal movements between
              two targets, paced by sounds with intervals that increased from 1
              to 6 s by 200 ms per cycle and then decreased again. The
              instruction emphasized smooth rhythmic movements without
              interspersed dwell times. We hypothesized that 1) when
              oscillatory motions slow down, smoothness decreases; 2) slower
              oscillatory motions are executed as submovements or even discrete
              movements; and 3) the transition between smooth oscillations and
              submovements shows hysteresis. An alternative hypothesis was that
              4) removing visual feedback restores smoothness, indicative of
              visually evoked corrections causing the irregularity. Results
              showed that humans could not perform slow and smooth oscillatory
              movements. Harmonicity decreased with longer intervals, and dwell
              times between cycles appeared and became prominent at slower
              speeds. Velocity profiles showed an increase with cycle duration

              evidence of hysteresis in the transition between these two types

              intermittent visually evoked corrections did not underlie this
              phenomenon. These results show that it is hard for humans to
              execute smooth rhythmic motions very slowly. Instead, they
              ``default'' to another dynamic primitive and compose motion as a
              sequence of overlapping submovements.NEW \& NOTEWORTHY
              Complementing a large body of prior work showing advantages of
              composing primitives to manage the complexity of motor control,
              this paper uncovers a limitation due to composition of behavior
              from dynamic primitives: while slower execution frequently makes
              a task easier, there is a limit and it is hard for humans to move
              very slowly. We suggest that this remarkable limitation is not
              due to inadequacies of muscle, nor to slow neural communication,
              but is a consequence of how the control of movement is organized.",

  author   = "Straw, Asher H and Hoogkamer, Wouter and Kram, Rodger",
  abstract = "PURPOSE: Historically, the efficiency of leg cycling has been
              difficult to change. However, arm cycling research indicates that
              relative crank angle changes can improve efficiency. Therefore,
              we investigated if leg cycling with different relative crank
              angles affects efficiency. METHODS: Ten healthy, male,
              recreational bicycle riders (27.8 $\pm$ 8.2 years, mean $\pm$ SD,
              mass 69.8 $\pm$ 3.2 kg) pedaled a pan-loaded cycle ergometer at a
              fixed power output of 150 watts at a cadence of 90 RPM. Each
              subject completed six, 5-min trials in random order at relative
              crank angles of 180°, 135°, 90°, 45°, 0°, and 180°. We averaged
              rates of oxygen uptake ([Formula: see text]) and carbon dioxide
              production ([Formula: see text]), and respiratory exchange ratio
              (RER) for the last 2 min of each trial. RESULTS: Crank angles
              other than 180° required a greater metabolic cost. As relative
              crank angle decreased from 180°, metabolic power monotonically
              increased by 1.6\% at 135° to 8.2\% greater when the relative
              crank angle was 0° (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We find that, unlike
              arm cycling, radically changing the relative crank angle on a
              bicycle from an out-of-phase (180°) to in-phase (0°) position
              decreases leg cycling efficiency by ~8\%. We attribute the
              increase to changes in cost of breathing, muscle co-activation,
              trunk stabilization, power fluctuations, and possibly lifting the
              legs during the upstroke. Our findings may have relevance in the

              effective treatment for balance impairments in Parkinson's
              disease (PD), few studies have examined if learning for balance
              control remains intact with PD. This study aimed to determine if
              learning for automatic postural responses is preserved in people
              with PD. METHODS: Eleven participants with moderate PD
              (68$\pm$6.4years; H\&Y: 2-3) on their usual medication maintained
              balance on a platform that oscillated forward and backward with
              variable amplitude and constant frequency. Participants completed
              42 trials during one training session, and retention and transfer
              tests following a 24-h delay. Performance was measured by
              comparing spatial and temporal measures of whole-body centre of
              mass (COM) with platform displacements. Learning was compared
              between participants with PD and previously reported, age-matched
              older adults (Van Ooteghem et al., 2010). RESULTS: Although
              postural responses in participants with PD were impaired compared
              to control participants, a majority of PD participants improved
              their postural responses with practice as revealed by reduced COM
              displacements and improved phase relationships between COM and
              platform motion. Rates of improvement were comparable between
              groups demonstrating preserved adaptive capacity for participants
              with PD. Similar to control participants, the PD group moved
              toward anticipatory COM control as a strategy for improving
              stability, exhibited short-term retention of performance
              improvements, and demonstrated generalizability of the learned
              responses. Rate of improvement with practice, but not retention,
              was related to severity of motor impairments. CONCLUSIONS:
              Patients with moderate PD on medication demonstrate retention of
              improvements in automatic postural responses with practice
              suggesting that intrinsic postural motor learning is preserved in
              this group.",

  abstract = "Human locomotion through natural environments requires precise
              coordination between the biomechanics of the bipedal gait cycle
              and the eye movements that gather the information needed to guide
              foot placement. However, little is known about how the visual and
              locomotor systems work together to support movement through the
              world. We developed a system to simultaneously record gaze and
              full-body kinematics during locomotion over different outdoor
              terrains. We found that not only do walkers tune their gaze
              behavior to the specific information needed to traverse paths of
              varying complexity but that they do so while maintaining a
              constant temporal look-ahead window across all terrains. This
              strategy allows walkers to use gaze to tailor their energetically
              optimal preferred gait cycle to the upcoming path in order to
              balance between the drive to move efficiently and the need to
              place the feet in stable locations. Eye movements and locomotion
              are intimately linked in a way that reflects the integration of
              energetic costs, environmental uncertainty, and momentary
              informational demands of the locomotor task. Thus, the
              relationship between gaze and gait reveals the structure of the
              sensorimotor decisions that support successful performance in the
              face of the varying demands of the natural world. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",

  abstract = "The adaptability of human bipedal locomotion has been studied
              using split-belt treadmill walking. Most of previous studies
              utilized experimental protocol under remarkably different split
              ratios (e.g. 1:2, 1:3, or 1:4). While, there is limited research
              with regard to adaptive process under the small speed ratios. It
              is important to know the nature of adaptive process under ratio
              smaller than 1:2, because systematic evaluation of the gait
              adaptation under small to moderate split ratios would enable us
              to examine relative contribution of two forms of adaptation
              (reactive feedback and predictive feedforward control) on gait
              adaptation. We therefore examined a gait behavior due to on
              split-belt treadmill adaptation under five belt speed difference
              conditions (from 1:1.2 to 1:2). Gait parameters related to
              reactive control (stance time) showed quick adjustments
              immediately after imposing the split-belt walking in all five
              speed ratios. Meanwhile, parameters related to predictive control
              (step length and anterior force) showed a clear pattern of
              adaptation and subsequent aftereffects except for the 1:1.2
              adaptation. Additionally, the 1:1.2 ratio was distinguished from
              other ratios by cluster analysis based on the relationship
              between the size of adaptation and the aftereffect. Our findings
              indicate that the reactive feedback control was involved in all
              the speed ratios tested and that the extent of reaction was
              proportionally dependent on the speed ratio of the split-belt. On
              the contrary, predictive feedforward control was necessary when
              the ratio of the split-belt was greater. These results enable us
              to consider how a given split-belt training condition would
              affect the relative contribution of the two strategies on gait
              adaptation, which must be considered when developing

              adaptation paradigms for the lower limbs are typically based on
              locomotion tasks, where the necessity of maintaining postural
              stability is the main driver of adaptation and could possibly
              mask other underlying processes. In this study we investigated
              whether small temporal or spatial asymmetries can trigger motor
              adaptations during stationary cycling, where stability is not
              directly compromised. Fourteen healthy individuals participated
              in two experiments: in one of the experiments the angle between
              the crank arms of the pedals was altered by 10 degrees to induce
              a temporal asymmetry; in the other the length of the right pedal
              was shortened by 2.4 cm to induce a spatial asymmetry. We
              recorded the acceleration of the crank arms and the EMG signals
              of 16 muscles (8 per leg). The analysis of the accelerometer data
              was used to investigate the presence of motor adaptations. Muscle
              synergy analysis was performed on each side to quantify changes
              in neuromuscular control. We found that feedforward motor
              adaptations are present in response to temporal asymmetries and
              are obtained by progressively shifting the activation patterns of
              two synergies on the right leg. Spatial asymmetries appear to
              trigger a feedback-driven response that does not present an
              aftereffect and is not consistent with a motor adaptation. This
              response is characterized by a step-like decrease in activity in
              the right gastrocnemius when the asymmetry is present and likely
              reflects the altered task demands.",

              actual metabolic minimization exists in locomotion, actual
              metabolic cost has yet to be measured during motor learning
              and/or arm reaching. Here, we measured metabolic power
              consumption using expired gas analysis, as humans learned novel
              arm reaching dynamics. We hypothesized that (1) metabolic power
              would decrease with motor learning and (2) muscle activity and
              coactivation would parallel changes in metabolic power. Seated
              subjects made horizontal planar reaching movements toward a
              target using a robotic arm. The novel dynamics involved
              compensating for a viscous curl force field that perturbed
              reaching movements. Metabolic power was measured continuously
              throughout the protocol. Subjects decreased movement error and
              learned the novel dynamics. By the end of learning, net metabolic
              power decreased by ~20\% (~0.1 W/kg) from initial learning.
              Muscle activity and coactivation also decreased with motor
              learning. Interestingly, distinct and significant reductions in
              metabolic power occurred even after muscle activity and
              coactivation had stabilized and movement changes were small.
              These results provide the first evidence of actual metabolic
              reduction during motor learning and for a reaching task. Further,
              they suggest that muscle activity may not explain changes in
              metabolic cost as completely as previously thought. Additional
              mechanisms such as more subtle features of arm muscle activity,
              changes in activity of other muscles, and/or more efficient
              neural processes may also underlie the reduction in metabolic
              cost during motor learning.",

              data. RELICA then uses these two measures to visualize and
              cluster the separated ICs, providing a within-subject measure of
              IC reliability that does not involve checking for its occurrence
              across subjects. We demonstrate the use of RELICA on EEG data
              recorded from 14 subjects performing a working memory experiment
              and show that many brain and ocular artifact ICs are correctly
              classified as ``stable'' (highly repeatable across decompositions
              of bootstrapped versions of the input data). Many stable ICs
              appear to originate in the brain, while other stable ICs account
              for identifiable non-brain processes such as line noise. RELICA
              might be used with any linear blind source separation algorithm
              to reduce the risk of basing conclusions on unstable or
              physiologically un-interpretable component processes.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: High-density electroencephelography (EEG) can provide
              an insight into human brain function during real-world activities
              with walking. Some recent studies have used EEG to characterize
              brain activity during walking, but the relative contributions of
              movement artifact and electrocortical activity have been
              difficult to quantify. We aimed to characterize movement artifact
              recorded by EEG electrodes at a range of walking speeds and to
              test the efficacy of artifact removal methods. We also quantified
              the similarity between movement artifact recorded by EEG
              electrodes and a head-mounted accelerometer. APPROACH: We used a
              novel experimental method to isolate and record movement artifact
              with EEG electrodes during walking. We blocked
              electrophysiological signals using a nonconductive layer
              (silicone swim cap) and simulated an electrically conductive
              scalp on top of the swim cap using a wig coated with conductive
              gel. We recorded motion artifact EEG data from nine young human
              subjects walking on a treadmill at speeds from 0.4 to 1.6 m
              s(-1). We then tested artifact removal methods including moving
              average and wavelet-based techniques. MAIN RESULTS: Movement
              artifact recorded with EEG electrodes varied considerably, across
              speed, subject, and electrode location. The movement artifact
              measured with EEG electrodes did not correlate well with head
              acceleration. All of the tested artifact removal methods
              attenuated low-frequency noise but did not completely remove
              movement artifact. The spectral power fluctuations in the
              movement artifact data resembled data from some previously
              published studies of EEG during walking. SIGNIFICANCE: Our
              results suggest that EEG data recorded during walking likely
              contains substantial movement artifact that: cannot be explained
              by head accelerations; varies across speed, subject, and channel;
              and cannot be removed using traditional signal processing
              methods. Future studies should focus on more sophisticated
              methods for removal of EEG movement artifact to advance the
              field.",

              electroencephalography (EEG) as a tool for mobile brain imaging
              due to its portability and fine time resolution. When EEG is
              combined with independent component analysis (ICA) and source
              localization techniques, it can model electrocortical activity as
              arising from temporally independent signals located in spatially
              distinct cortical areas. However, for mobile tasks, it is not
              clear how movement artifacts influence ICA and source
              localization. We devised a novel method to collect pure movement
              artifact data (devoid of any electrophysiological signals) with a
              256-channel EEG system. We first blocked true electrocortical
              activity using a silicone swim cap. Over the silicone layer, we
              placed a simulated scalp with electrical properties similar to
              real human scalp. We collected EEG movement artifact signals from
              ten healthy, young subjects wearing this setup as they walked on
              a treadmill at speeds from 0.4-1.6 m/s. We performed ICA and
              dipole fitting on the EEG movement artifact data to quantify how
              accurately these methods would identify the artifact signals as
              non-neural. ICA and dipole fitting accurately localized 99\% of
              the independent components in non-neural locations or lacked
              dipolar characteristics. The remaining 1\% of sources had
              locations within the brain volume and low residual variances, but
              had topographical maps, power spectra, time courses, and event
              related spectral perturbations typical of non-neural sources.
              Caution should be exercised when interpreting ICA for data that
              includes semi-periodic artifacts including artifact arising from
              human walking. Alternative methods are needed for the
              identification and separation of movement artifact in mobile EEG
              signals, especially methods that can be performed in real time.
              Separating true brain signals from motion artifact could clear
              the way for EEG brain computer interfaces for assistance during
              mobile activities, such as walking.",

              mutant lines that suffer from impaired Purkinje cell output
              (Pcd), Purkinje cell potentiation (L7-Pp2b), molecular layer
              interneuron output (L7-$\Delta$$\gamma$2), and granule cell
              output ($\alpha$6-Cacna1a). We found that locomotion performance
              was severely impaired with small steps and long step times in Pcd

              pairing obstacle appearances with preceding tones at fixed time

              showed inaccurate and inconsistent adaptive walking patterns.
              Furthermore, all mutants exhibited altered front-hind and

              adaptation, and inconsistent walking stepping patterns while
              crossing obstacles. Instead, motivation and avoidance behavior
              were not compromised in any of the mutants during the Erasmus

              abnormalities in cerebellar microcircuitry can translate into
              pronounced impairments in locomotion performance and adaptation

              level surface. Subjects walked on a treadmill at 0\% and 15\%
              grades for 30 min while we recorded electroencephalography (EEG).
              We used independent component (IC) analysis to parse EEG signals
              into maximally independent sources and then computed dipole
              estimations for each IC. We clustered cortical source ICs and
              analyzed event-related spectral perturbations synchronized to
              gait events. Theta power fluctuated across the gait cycle for
              both conditions, but was greater during incline walking in the
              anterior cingulate, sensorimotor and posterior parietal clusters.
              We found greater gamma power during level walking in the left
              sensorimotor and anterior cingulate clusters. We also found
              distinct alpha and beta fluctuations, depending on the phase of
              the gait cycle for the left and right sensorimotor cortices,
              indicating cortical lateralization for both walking conditions.
              We validated the results by isolating movement artifact. We found
              that the frequency activation patterns of the artifact were
              different than the actual EEG data, providing evidence that the
              differences between walking conditions were cortically driven
              rather than a residual artifact of the experiment. These findings
              suggest that the locomotor pattern adjustments necessary to walk
              on an incline compared with level surface may require supraspinal

              cingulate, and posterior parietal areas. These results are a

  abstract = "Recently, it has been demonstrated that bicycling ability remains
              surprisingly preserved in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients who
              suffer from freezing of gait. Cycling has been also proposed as a
              therapeutic means of treating PD symptoms, with some preliminary
              success. The neural mechanisms behind these phenomena are however
              not yet understood. One of the reasons is that the investigations
              of neuronal activity during pedaling have been up to now limited
              to PET and fMRI studies, which restrict the temporal resolution
              of analysis, and to scalp EEG focused on cortical activation.
              However, deeper brain structures like the basal ganglia are also
              associated with control of voluntary motor movements like cycling
              and are affected by PD. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes
              implanted for therapy in PD patients provide rare and unique
              access to directly record basal ganglia activity with a very high
              temporal resolution. In this paper we present an experimental
              setup allowing combined investigation of basal ganglia local
              field potentials (LFPs) and scalp EEG underlying bicycling in PD
              patients. The main part of the setup is a bike simulator
              consisting of a classic Dutch-style bicycle frame mounted on a
              commercially available ergometer. The pedal resistance is
              controllable in real-time by custom software and the pedal
              position is continuously tracked by custom Arduino-based
              electronics using optical and magnetic sensors. A portable
              bioamplifier records the pedal position signal, the angle of the
              knee, and the foot pressure together with EEG, EMG, and basal
              ganglia LFPs. A handlebar-mounted display provides additional
              information for patients riding the bike simulator, including the
              current and target pedaling rate. In order to demonstrate the
              utility of the setup, example data from pilot recordings are
              shown. The presented experimental setup provides means to
              directly record basal ganglia activity not only during cycling
              but also during other movement tasks in patients who have
              undergone DBS treatment. Thus, it can facilitate studies
              comparing bicycling and walking, to elucidate why PD patients
              often retain the ability to bicycle despite severe freezing of
              gait. Moreover it can help clarifying the mechanism through which
              cycling may have therapeutic benefits.",

              rewarding (or less effortful) option. However, they also move
              faster toward that stimulus [1-5]. This suggests that reward and
              effort not only affect decision-making, they also influence motor
              control [6, 7]. How does the brain compute the effort
              requirements of a task? Here, we considered data acquired during
              walking, reaching, flying, or isometric force production. In
              analyzing the decision-making and motor-control behaviors of
              various animals, we considered the possibility that the brain may
              estimate effort objectively, via the metabolic energy consumed to
              produce the action. We measured the energetic cost of reaching
              and found that, like walking, it was convex in time, with a
              global minimum, implying that there existed a movement speed that
              minimized effort. However, reward made it worthwhile to be
              energetically inefficient. Using a framework in which utility of
              an action depended on reward and energetic cost, both discounted
              in time, we found that it was possible to account for a body of
              data in which animals were free to choose how to move (reach slow
              or fast), as well as what to do (walk or fly, produce force F1 or
              F2). We suggest that some forms of decision-making and motor
              control may share a common utility in which the brain represents
              the effort associated with performing an action objectively via
              its metabolic energy cost and then, like reward, temporally
              discounts it as a function of movement duration.",

              ground (LW), ramp ascent (RA), and stair ascent (SA)).
              Non-invasive active-electrode scalp electroencephalography (EEG)
              signals were recorded and a systematic EEG processing method was
              implemented to reduce artifacts. Source localization combined
              with independent component analysis and k-means clustering
              revealed the involvement of four clusters in the brain during the
              walking tasks: Left and Right Occipital Lobe (LOL, ROL),
              Posterior Parietal Cortex (PPC), and Central Sensorimotor Cortex
              (SMC). Results showed that the changes of spectral power in the
              PPC and SMC clusters were associated with the level of motor task
              demands. Specifically, we observed $\alpha$ and $\beta$
              suppression at the beginning of the gait cycle in both SA and RA
              walking (relative to LW) in the SMC. Additionally, we observed
              significant $\beta$ rebound (synchronization) at the initial
              swing phase of the gait cycle, which may be indicative of active
              cortical signaling involved in maintaining the current locomotor
              state. An increase of low $\gamma$ band power in this cluster was
              also found in SA walking. In the PPC, the low $\gamma$ band power
              increased with the level of task demands (from LW to RA and SA).
              Additionally, our results provide evidence that electrocortical
              amplitude modulations (relative to average gait cycle) are
              correlated with the level of difficulty in locomotion tasks.
              Specifically, the modulations in the PPC shifted to higher
              frequency bands when the subjects walked in RA and SA conditions.
              Moreover, low $\gamma$ modulations in the central sensorimotor
              area were observed in the LW walking and shifted to lower
              frequency bands in RA and SA walking. These findings extend our
              understanding of cortical dynamics of human walking at different
              level of locomotion task demands and reinforces the growing body
              of literature supporting a shared-control paradigm between spinal
              and cortical networks during locomotion.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: the recent emergence and success of
              electroencephalography (EEG) in low-cost portable devices, has
              opened the door to a new generation of applications processing a
              small number of EEG channels for health monitoring and
              brain-computer interfacing. These recordings are, however,
              contaminated by many sources of noise degrading the signals of
              interest, thus compromising the interpretation of the underlying
              brain state. In this paper, we propose a new data-driven
              algorithm to effectively remove ocular and muscular artifacts
              from single-channel EEG: the surrogate-based artifact removal
              (SuBAR). METHODS: by means of the time-frequency analysis of
              surrogate data, our approach is able to identify and filter
              automatically ocular and muscular artifacts embedded in
              single-channel EEG. RESULTS: in a comparative study using
              artificially contaminated EEG signals, the efficacy of the
              algorithm in terms of noise removal and signal distortion was
              superior to other traditionally-employed single-channel EEG
              denoizing techniques: wavelet thresholding and the canonical
              correlation analysis combined with an advanced version of the
              empirical mode decomposition. Even in the presence of mild and
              severe artifacts, our artifact removal method provides a relative
              error 4 to 5 times lower than traditional techniques.
              SIGNIFICANCE: in view of these results, the SuBAR method is a
              promising solution for mobile environments, such as ambulatory
              healthcare systems, sleep stage scoring, or anesthesia

  author   = "Chemin, B and Huang, G and Mulders, D and Mouraux, A",
  abstract = "Background Many sensorimotor functions are intrinsically
              rhythmic, and are underlined by neural processes that are
              functionally distinct from neural responses related to the
              processing of transient events. EEG frequency tagging is a
              technique that is increasingly used in neuroscience to study
              these processes. It relies on the fact that perceiving and/or
              producing rhythms generates periodic neural activity that
              translates into periodic variations of the EEG signal. In the EEG
              spectrum, those variations appear as peaks localized at the
              frequency of the rhythm and its harmonics. New method Many
              natural rhythms, such as music or dance, are not strictly
              periodic and, instead, show fluctuations of their period over
              time. Here, we introduce a time-warping method to identify
              non-strictly-periodic EEG activities in the frequency domain.
              Results EEG time-warping can be used to characterize the
              sensorimotor activity related to the performance of self-paced
              rhythmic finger movements. Furthermore, the EEG time-warping
              method can disentangle auditory- and movement-related EEG
              activity produced when participants perform rhythmic movements
              synchronized to an acoustic rhythm. This is possible because the
              movement-related activity has different period fluctuations than
              the auditory-related activity. Comparison with existing methods
              With the classic frequency-tagging approach, rhythm fluctuations
              result in a spreading of the peaks to neighboring frequencies, to
              the point that they cannot be distinguished from background
              noise. Conclusions The proposed time-warping procedure is as a
              simple and effective mean to study natural non-strictly-periodic
              rhythmic neural processes such as rhythmic movement production,
              acoustic rhythm perception and sensorimotor synchronization.",

              changes in behavior and gait with increased sensory and cognitive
              load, but the underlying cortical mechanisms remain largely
              unknown. Here, in a Mobile Brain/Body Imaging (MoBI) approach
              sixteen young adults walked on a treadmill with high-density EEG
              while 3D motion capture tracked kinematics of the head and feet.
              Visual load was manipulated with the presentation of optic flow
              with and without continuous mediolateral perturbations. The
              effects of cognitive load were assessed by the performance of a

              brain dynamics during human balance control due to limitations in
              brain-imaging modalities. The goal of this study was to determine
              whether by using high-density electroencephalography (EEG) and
              independent component analysis, we can identify common cortical
              responses to visual and physical balance perturbations during
              walking and standing. We studied the responses of 30 healthy
              young adults to sensorimotor perturbations that challenged their
              balance. Subjects performed four 10 min trials of beam walking
              and tandem stance while either being mediolaterally pulled at the
              waist or viewing brief 20° field-of-view rotations in virtual
              reality. We recorded high-density EEG, motion capture, lower leg
              electromyography (EMG), and neck EMG. We hypothesized that both
              physical pull and visual rotation perturbations would elicit
              time-frequency fluctuations in theta (4-8 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz)
              bands, with increased occipito-parietal activity during visual
              rotations compared with pull perturbations. Our results confirmed
              this hypothesis. For both perturbations, we found early theta
              synchronization and late alpha-beta (8-30 Hz) desynchronization
              following perturbation onset. This pattern was strongest in
              occipito-parietal areas during visual perturbations and strongest
              in sensorimotor areas during pull perturbations. These results
              suggest a similar time-frequency electrocortical pattern when
              humans respond to sensorimotor conflict, but with substantive
              differences in the brain areas involved for visual versus
              physical perturbations. Our findings may have important

              groupings and the active force vectors produced during postural
              responses under several biomechanically distinct conditions. We
              aimed to determine whether such synergies represent a generalized
              control strategy for postural control or if they are merely
              specific to each postural task. Postural responses to
              multidirectional translations at different fore-hind paw

              stance distance-four were similar to our previous analysis of
              translation, whereas the fifth accounted for the newly added

              responses from different perturbation directions, as well as
              different postural strategies. Postural responses to
              multidirectional support-surface translations in 16 muscles of
              the lower back and leg were analyzed in nine healthy subjects.
              Six or fewer muscle synergies were required to reproduce the
              postural responses of each subject. The composition and temporal
              activation of several muscle synergies identified across all
              subjects were consistent with the previously identified ``ankle''
              and ``hip'' strategies in human postural responses. Moreover,
              intertrial variability in muscle activation patterns was
              successfully reproduced by modulating the activity of the various
              muscle synergies. This suggests that trial-to-trial variations in
              the activation of individual muscles are correlated and,
              moreover, represent variations in the amplitude of descending
              neural commands that activate individual muscle synergies.
              Finally, composition and temporal activation of most of the
              muscle synergies were similar across subjects. These results
              suggest that muscle synergies represent a general neural strategy
              underlying muscle coordination in postural tasks.",

  abstract = "We recently demonstrated that a set of five functional muscle
              synergies were sufficient to characterize both hindlimb muscle
              activity and active forces during automatic postural responses in
              cats standing at multiple postural configurations. This
              characterization depended critically upon the assumption that the
              endpoint force vector (synergy force vector) produced by the
              activation of each muscle synergy rotated with the limb axis as
              the hindlimb posture varied in the sagittal plane. Here, we used
              a detailed, 3D static model of the hindlimb to confirm that this
              assumption is biomechanically plausible: as we varied the model
              posture, simulated synergy force vectors rotated monotonically
              with the limb axis in the parasagittal plane (r2=0.94+/-0.08). We
              then tested whether a neural strategy of using these five
              functional muscle synergies provides the same force-generating
              capability as controlling each of the 31 muscles individually. We
              compared feasible force sets (FFSs) from the model with and
              without a muscle synergy organization. FFS volumes were
              significantly reduced with the muscle synergy organization
              (F=1556.01, p<0.01), and as posture varied, the synergy-limited
              FFSs changed in shape, consistent with changes in experimentally
              measured active forces. In contrast, nominal FFS shapes were
              invariant with posture, reinforcing prior findings that postural
              forces cannot be predicted by hindlimb biomechanics alone. We
              propose that an internal model for postural force generation may
              coordinate functional muscle synergies that are invariant in
              intrinsic limb coordinates, and this reduced-dimension control
              scheme reduces the set of forces available for postural control.",

              injury may alter the organization of motor modules and their
              biomechanical outputs. We first tested the hypothesis that muscle
              activation patterns during walking are produced through the
              variable activation of a small set of motor modules. In 20
              healthy control subjects, EMG signals from eight leg muscles were
              measured across a range of walking speeds. Four motor modules
              identified through nonnegative matrix factorization were
              sufficient to account for variability of muscle activation from
              step to step and across speeds. Next, consistent with the
              clinical notion of abnormal limb flexion-extension synergies
              post-stroke, we tested the hypothesis that subjects with
              post-stroke hemiparesis would have altered motor modules, leading
              to impaired walking performance. In post-stroke subjects (n =

              were needed to account for muscle activation during walking at
              preferred speed compared with controls. Fewer modules resulted
              from merging of the modules observed in healthy controls,
              suggesting reduced independence of neural control signals. The
              number of modules was correlated to preferred walking speed,
              speed modulation, step length asymmetry, and propulsive
              asymmetry. Our results suggest a common modular organization of
              muscle coordination underlying walking in both healthy and
              post-stroke subjects. Identification of motor modules may lead to

              Modern technology is substantially immune to some of these
              noises, but not to the baseline noise and the movement artifact
              noise. These noise sources have frequency spectra that

              magnitude of significant differences over time without a priori
              selection of time bins. However, tANOVA revealed only the largest

              with later onsets and shorter durations than those identified
              using wfANOVA (P < 0.02). Furthermore, wfANOVA required
              significantly fewer (~1/4;$\times$; P < 0.015) significant F

              nervous system has when selecting muscle activation patterns.
              Here, we identified feasible ranges of individual muscle activity
              during force production in a musculoskeletal model to quantify
              the degree to which biomechanical redundancy allows for
              variability in muscle activation patterns. In a detailed cat
              hindlimb model matched to the posture of three cats, we
              identified the lower and upper bounds on muscle activity in each
              of 31 muscles during static endpoint force production across
              different force directions and magnitudes. Feasible ranges of
              muscle activation were relatively unconstrained across force
              magnitudes such that only a few (0-13\%) muscles were found to be
              truly ``necessary'' (e.g. exhibited non-zero lower bounds) at
              physiological force ranges. Most of the muscles were
              ``optional'', having zero lower bounds, and frequently had
              ``maximal'' upper bounds as well. Moreover, ``optional'' muscles
              were never selected by optimization methods that either minimized
              muscle stress, or that scaled the pattern required for maximum
              force generation. Therefore, biomechanical constraints were
              generally insufficient to restrict or specify muscle activation
              levels for producing a force in a given direction, and many
              muscle patterns exist that could deviate substantially from one
              another but still achieve the task. Our approach could be
              extended to identify the feasible limits of variability in muscle

              Using motor module (a.k.a., muscle synergy) analyses, we

              professionally trained ballet dancers (experts) and untrained
              novices that accompanied differences in walking balance

              During beam walking, we found that experts recruited more motor
              modules than novices, suggesting an increase in motor repertoire

              rehabilitation in individuals with mild to moderate idiopathic

              increased motor module number despite improvements in behavioral
              measures of balance and gait performance. Instead, motor modules
              were more consistently recruited and distinctly organized

  abstract = "Walking after stroke is often described as requiring excessive
              muscle co-contraction, yet, evidence that co-contraction is a
              ubiquitous motor control strategy for this population remains
              inconclusive. Co-contraction, the simultaneous activation of
              agonist and antagonist muscles, can be assessed with
              electromyography (EMG) but is often described qualitatively.
              Here, our goal is to determine if co-contraction is associated
              with gait impairments following stroke. Fifteen individuals with
              chronic stroke and nine healthy controls walked on an
              instrumented treadmill at self-selected speed. Surface EMGs were
              collected from the medial gastrocnemius (MG), soleus (SOL), and
              tibialis anterior (TA) of each leg. EMG envelope amplitudes were
              assessed in three ways: (1) no normalization, (2) normalization
              to the maximum value across the gait cycle, or (3) normalization
              to maximal M-wave. Three co-contraction indices were calculated
              across each agonist/antagonist muscle pair (MG/TA and SOL/TA) to
              assess the effect of using various metrics to quantify
              co-contraction. Two factor ANOVAs were used to compare effects of
              group and normalization for each metric. Co-contraction during
              the terminal stance (TSt) phase of gait is not different between
              healthy controls and the paretic leg of individuals post-stroke,
              regardless of the metric used to quantify co-contraction.
              Interestingly, co-contraction was similar between M-max and
              non-normalized EMG; however, normalization does not impact the
              ability to resolve group differences. While a modest correlation
              is revealed between the amount of TSt co-contraction and walking
              speed, the relationship is not sufficiently strong to motivate
              further exploration of a causal link between co-contraction and
              walking function after stroke. Co-contraction does not appear to
              be a common strategy employed by individuals after stroke. We
              recommend exploration of alternative EMG analysis approaches in
              an effort to learn more about the causal mechanisms of gait
              impairment following stroke.",

              understood in the context of walking control. Here, we discuss
              our recent work on locomotor adaptation, which is an error driven
              motor learning process used to alter spatiotemporal elements of
              walking. Locomotor adaptation can be induced using a split-belt
              treadmill that controls the speed of each leg independently.
              Practicing split-belt walking changes the coordination between
              the legs, resulting in storage of a new walking pattern. Here, we
              review findings from this experimental paradigm regarding the
              learning and generalization of locomotor adaptation. First, we
              discuss how split-belt walking adaptation develops slowly
              throughout childhood and adolescence. Second, we demonstrate that
              conscious effort to change the walking pattern during split-belt
              training can speed up adaptation but worsens retention. In
              contrast, distraction (i.e., performing a dual task) during
              training slows adaptation but improves retention. Finally, we
              show the walking pattern acquired on the split-belt treadmill
              generalizes to natural walking when vision is removed. This
              suggests that treadmill learning can be generalized to different
              contexts if visual cues specific to the treadmill are removed.
              These findings allow us to highlight the many future questions
              that will need to be answered in order to develop more rational

              clinicians and other health professionals to assess gait patterns
              related to functional limitations due to neurological or
              orthopedic conditions. The purpose of this study was to assess
              the validity of a body-worn inertial sensor system
              (RehaGait\textregistered{}) for measuring spatiotemporal gait
              characteristics compared to a stationary treadmill (Zebris) and
              the reliability of both systems at different walking speeds and
              slopes. METHODS: Gait analysis was performed during treadmill
              walking at different speeds (habitual walking speed (normal
              speed); 15 \% above normal walking speed; 15 \% below normal
              walking speed) and slopes (0 \% slope; 15 \% slope) in 22 healthy
              participants twice 1 week apart. Walking speed, stride length,
              cadence and stride time were computed from the inertial sensor
              system and the stationary treadmill and compared using repeated
              measures analysis of variance. Effect sizes of differences
              between systems were assessed using Cohen's d, and limits of
              agreement and systematic bias were computed. RESULTS: The
              RehaGait\textregistered{} system slightly overestimated stride
              length (+2.7 \%) and stride time (+0.8 \%) and underestimate
              cadence (-1.5 \%) with small effect sizes for all speeds and
              slopes (Cohen's d $\leq$ 0.44) except slow speed at 15 \% slope
              (Cohen's d > 0.80). Walking speed obtained with the
              RehaGait\textregistered{} system closely matched the speed set on
              the treadmill tachometer. Intraclass correlation coefficients
              (ICC) were excellent for speed, cadence and stride time and for
              stride length at normal and fast speed at 0 \% slope (ICC:
              .91-1.00). Good ICC values were found for stride length at slow
              speed at 0 \% slope and all speeds at 15 \% slope (ICC: .73-.90).
              Both devices had excellent reliability for most gait
              characteristics (ICC: .91-1.00) except good reliability for the
              RehaGait\textregistered{} for stride length at normal and fast
              speed at 0 \% slope and at slow speed at 15 \% slope (ICC:
              .80-.87). CONCLUSIONS: Larger limits of agreement for walking at
              15 \% slope suggests that uphill walking may influence the
              reliability of the RehaGait\textregistered{} system. The
              RehaGait\textregistered{} is a valid and reliable tool for
              measuring spatiotemporal gait characteristics during level and
              inclined treadmill walking.",

              with more than 30\% of people older than 65 suffering a fall at
              least once a year. One element often overlooked in the assessment
              of falls is whether a person's balance, walking ability, and
              overall falls risk is affected by performing activities of daily
              living such as walking. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the
              immediate impact of incline walking at a moderate pace on falls
              risk, leg strength, reaction time, gait, and balance in 75
              healthy adults from 30 to 79 years of age. Subjects were
              subdivided into 5 equal groups based on their age (group 1, 30-39
              years; group 2, 40-49 years; group 3, 50-59 years; group 4, 60-69
              years; group 5, 70-79 years). METHODS: Each person's falls risk
              (using the Physiological Profile Assessment), simple reaction
              time, leg strength, walking ability, and standing balance were
              assessed before and after a period of incline walking on an
              automated treadmill. The walking task consisted of three 5-minute
              trials at a faster than preferred pace. Fatigue during walking
              was elicited by increasing the treadmill incline in increments of
              2° (from level) every minute to a maximum of 8°. RESULTS: As
              predicted, significant age-related differences were observed
              before the walking activity. In general, increasing age was
              associated with declines in gait speed, lower limb strength,
              slower reaction times, and increases in overall falls risk.
              Following the treadmill task, older adults exhibited increased
              sway (path length 60-69 years; 10.2 $\pm$ 0.7 to 12.1 $\pm$ 0.7
              cm: 70-79 years; 12.8 $\pm$ 1.1 to 15.1 $\pm$ 0.8 cm), slower
              reaction times (70-79 years; 256 $\pm$ 6 to 287 $\pm$ 8 ms), and
              declines in lower limb strength (60-69 years; 36 $\pm$ 2 to 31
              $\pm$ 1 kg: 70-79 years; 32.3 $\pm$ 2 to 27 $\pm$ 1 kg). However,
              a significant increase in overall falls risk (pre; 0.51 $\pm$
              0.17: post; 1.01 $\pm$ 0.18) was only seen in the oldest group
              (70-79 years). For all other persons (30-69 years), changes
              resulting from the treadmill-walking task did not lead to a
              significant increase in falls risk. CONCLUSIONS: As most falls
              occur when an individual is moving and/or fatigued, assessing
              functional properties related to balance, gait, strength, and
              falls risk in older adults both at rest and following activity
              may provide additional insight.",

  abstract = "[Purpose] The purpose of this study was to determine if an
              inclined treadmill with rhythmic auditory stimulation gait
              training can improve balance and gait ability in stroke patients.
              [Subjects and Methods] Thirty participants were randomly divided
              into three groups: inclined treadmill with rhythmic auditory
              stimulation training group (n=10), inclined treadmill training
              group (n=10), and treadmill training group (n=10). For all
              groups, the training was conducted for 4 weeks, 30 minutes per
              session, 5 times per week. Two subjects dropped out before study
              completion. [Results] All variables of balance and gait, except
              for the timed up and go test in the treadmill group,
              significantly improved in all groups. Moreover, all variables
              showed a more significant improvement in the inclined treadmill
              with rhythmic auditory stimulation group when compared with the
              other groups. Timed up and go test, Berg balance scale, 6 m
              walking test, walking speed, and symmetric index were
              significantly improved in the inclined treadmill group when
              compared with the treadmill group. [Conclusion] Thus, for stroke
              patients receiving gait training, inclined treadmill with
              rhythmic auditory stimulation training was more effective in
              maintaining balance and gait than inclined treadmill without
              rhythmic auditory stimulation or only treadmill training.",

  abstract = "Tracking whole-body human pose in physical human-machine
              interactions is challenging because of highly dimensional human
              motions and lack of inexpensive, nonintrusive motion sensors in
              outdoor environment. In this paper, we present a computational
              scheme to estimate the human whole-body pose with application to
              bicycle riding using a small set of wearable sensors. The
              estimation scheme is built on the fusion of gyroscopes,
              accelerometers, force sensors, and physical rider-bicycle
              interaction constraints through an extended Kalman filter design.
              The use of physical rider-bicycle interaction constraints helps
              not only eliminate the integration drifts of inertial sensor
              measurements but also reduce the number of the needed wearable
              sensors for pose estimation. For each set of the upper and the
              lower limb, only one tri-axial gyroscope is needed to accurately
              obtain the 3-D pose information. The drift-free, reliable
              estimation performance is demonstrated through both indoor and

              25) and optical skin markers were attached onto anatomical pelvic
              landmarks for MOCAP measurements. Comparisons between IMU and
              MOCAP by Bland-Altman plots demonstrated that measurements were
              between 2SD of the absolute difference and Pearson's correlation
              coefficients were between 0.85 and 0.94. Frontal plane pelvic

              transfer of subject-specific motions to robots with different
              embodiments. To this end, captured subject-specific motion is
              normalized regarding the subject's height and weight by using a
              reference kinematics and dynamics model of the human body, the

              motion of objects with which the subject is interacting as well.
              In addition to the description of the MMM reference model, we

              biomedical applications, primarily since they can be implemented
              both in indoor and outdoor applications. In this study, a Trunk
              Motion System (TMS) using printed Body-Worn Sensors (BWS) is
              designed and developed. TMS can measure three-dimensional (3D)
              trunk motions, is lightweight, and is a portable and non-invasive
              system. After the recognition of sensor locations, twelve BWSs
              were printed on stretchable clothing with the purpose of
              measuring the 3D trunk movements. To integrate BWSs data, a
              neural network data fusion algorithm was used. The outcome of
              this algorithm along with the actual 3D anatomical movements
              (obtained by Qualisys system) were used to calibrate the TMS.
              Three healthy participants with different physical
              characteristics participated in the calibration tests. Seven
              different tasks (each repeated three times) were performed,
              involving five planar, and two multiplanar movements. Results
              showed that the accuracy of TMS system was less than 1.0°, 0.8°,
              0.6°, 0.8°, 0.9°, and 1.3° for flexion/extension, left/right
              lateral bending, left/right axial rotation, and multi-planar
              motions, respectively. In addition, the accuracy of TMS for the
              identified movement was less than 2.7°. TMS, developed to monitor
              and measure the trunk orientations, can have diverse applications
              in clinical, biomechanical, and ergonomic studies to prevent

              significantly greater (P $\leq$ .001) RMSE than the technological
              error. RMSE was systematically higher (P $\leq$ .001) for the
              long complex task with a mean on all joints of 2.8° compared to

              Additionally, IMUs accuracy was affected by the complexity and
              duration of the tasks. Nevertheless, technological error remained
              under 5° RMSE during handling tasks, which shows potential to

              purpose of this study was to quantify the mechanical performance
              of the orthosis during human walking. Three subjects walked at a
              range of speeds wearing ankle-foot orthoses with either one or
              two artificial muscles working in parallel. The orthosis produced
              similar total peak plantar flexor torque and network across
              speeds independent of the number of muscles used. The orthosis
              generated approximately 57\% of the peak ankle plantar flexor
              torque during stance and performed approximately 70\% of the
              positive plantar flexor work done during normal walking.
              Artificial muscle bandwidth and force-length properties were the
              two primary factors limiting torque production. The lack of peak
              force and work differences between single and double muscle

              altered their ankle kinematics between conditions resulting in
              changes in artificial muscle length. In the double muscle

              Nine healthy individuals completed three 30 min sessions walking

              powered walking progressed from +7\% to -10\% of that during
              unpowered walking. With practice, subjects significantly reduced
              soleus muscle activity (by approximately 28\% root mean square

              power generated by all of the joints summed (ankle, knee and hip)
              during unpowered walking. Decreases in total joint positive
              mechanical power due to powered ankle assistance ( approximately
              22\%) were not proportional to reductions in net metabolic power
              ( approximately 10\%). The ;apparent efficiency' of the ankle
              joint muscle-tendon system during human walking ( approximately

              from actively shortening ankle plantar flexor muscle fibers to
              ankle muscle-tendon positive work during walking on steep uphill
              inclines. Although exoskeletons delivered 61\% more mechanical

              humans are very well-tuned for locomotion. Metabolic energy used
              during walking can be partly replaced by power input from an
              exoskeleton, but is it possible to reduce metabolic rate without
              providing an additional energy source? This would require an
              improvement in the efficiency of the human-machine system as a
              whole, and would be remarkable given the apparent optimality of
              human gait. Here we show that the metabolic rate of human walking
              can be reduced by an unpowered ankle exoskeleton. We built a
              lightweight elastic device that acts in parallel with the user's
              calf muscles, off-loading muscle force and thereby reducing the
              metabolic energy consumed in contractions. The device uses a
              mechanical clutch to hold a spring as it is stretched and relaxed
              by ankle movements when the foot is on the ground, helping to
              fulfil one function of the calf muscles and Achilles tendon.
              Unlike muscles, however, the clutch sustains force passively. The
              exoskeleton consumes no chemical or electrical energy and
              delivers no net positive mechanical work, yet reduces the
              metabolic cost of walking by 7.2 $\pm$ 2.6\% for healthy human
              users under natural conditions, comparable to savings with
              powered devices. Improving upon walking economy in this way is
              analogous to altering the structure of the body such that it is
              more energy-effective at walking. While strong natural pressures
              have already shaped human locomotion, improvements in efficiency
              are still possible. Much remains to be learned about this
              seemingly simple behaviour.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Previous reports of the mechanics and energetics of
              post-stroke hemiparetic walking have either not combined
              estimates of mechanical and metabolic energy or computed external
              mechanical work based on the limited combined limbs method. Here
              we present a comparison of the mechanics and energetics of
              hemiparetic and unimpaired walking at a matched speed. METHODS:
              Mechanical work done on the body centre of mass (COM) was
              computed by the individual limbs method and work done at
              individual leg joints was computed with an inverse dynamics
              analysis. Both estimates were converted to average powers and
              related to simultaneous estimates of net metabolic power,
              determined via indirect calorimetry. Efficiency of positive work
              was calculated as the ratio of average positive mechanical power
              [Formula: see text] to net metabolic power. RESULTS: Total
              [Formula: see text] was 20\% greater for the hemiparetic group
              (H) than for the unimpaired control group (C) (0.49 vs. 0.41 W ·
              kg(-1)). The greater [Formula: see text] was partly attributed to
              the paretic limb of hemiparetic walkers not providing
              appropriately timed push-off [Formula: see text] in the
              step-to-step transition. This led to compensatory non-paretic
              limb hip and knee [Formula: see text] which resulted in greater
              total mechanical work. Efficiency of positive work was not
              different between H and C. CONCLUSIONS: Increased work, not
              decreased efficiency, explains the greater metabolic cost of

  author   = "Takahashi, Kota Z and Lewek, Michael D and Sawicki, Gregory S",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: In persons post-stroke, diminished ankle joint
              function can contribute to inadequate gait propulsion. To target
              paretic ankle impairments, we developed a neuromechanics-based
              powered ankle exoskeleton. Specifically, this exoskeleton
              supplies plantarflexion assistance that is proportional to the
              user's paretic soleus electromyography (EMG) amplitude only
              during a phase of gait when the stance limb is subjected to an
              anteriorly directed ground reaction force (GRF). The purpose of
              this feasibility study was to examine the short-term effects of
              the powered ankle exoskeleton on the mechanics and energetics of
              gait. METHODS: Five subjects with stroke walked with a powered
              ankle exoskeleton on the paretic limb for three 5 minute
              sessions. We analyzed the peak paretic ankle plantarflexion
              moment, paretic ankle positive work, symmetry of GRF propulsion
              impulse, and net metabolic power. RESULTS: The exoskeleton
              increased the paretic plantarflexion moment by 16\% during the
              powered walking trials relative to unassisted walking condition
              (p < .05). Despite this enhanced paretic ankle moment, there was
              no significant increase in paretic ankle positive work, or
              changes in any other mechanical variables with the powered
              assistance. The exoskeleton assistance appeared to reduce the net
              metabolic power gradually with each 5 minute repetition, though
              no statistical significance was found. In three of the subjects,
              the paretic soleus activation during the propulsion phase of
              stance was reduced during the powered assistance compared to
              unassisted walking (35\% reduction in the integrated EMG
              amplitude during the third powered session). CONCLUSIONS: This
              feasibility study demonstrated that the exoskeleton can enhance
              paretic ankle moment. Future studies with greater sample size and
              prolonged sessions are warranted to evaluate the effects of the
              powered ankle exoskeleton on overall gait outcomes in persons
              post-stroke.",

  abstract = "Measuring biomechanical work performed by humans and other
              animals is critical for understanding muscle-tendon function,
              joint-specific contributions and energy-saving mechanisms during
              locomotion. Inverse dynamics is often employed to estimate
              joint-level contributions, and deformable body estimates can be
              used to study work performed by the foot. We recently discovered
              that these commonly used experimental estimates fail to explain
              whole-body energy changes observed during human walking. By
              re-analyzing previously published data, we found that about 25\%
              (8 J) of total positive energy changes of/about the body's
              center-of-mass and >30\% of the energy changes during the
              Push-off phase of walking were not explained by conventional
              joint- and segment-level work estimates, exposing a gap in our
              fundamental understanding of work production during gait. Here,
              we present a novel Energy-Accounting analysis that integrates
              various empirical measures of work and energy to elucidate the
              source of unexplained biomechanical work. We discovered that by
              extending conventional 3 degree-of-freedom (DOF) inverse dynamics
              (estimating rotational work about joints) to 6DOF (rotational and
              translational) analysis of the hip, knee, ankle and foot, we
              could fully explain the missing positive work. This revealed that
              Push-off work performed about the hip may be >50\% greater than
              conventionally estimated (9.3 versus 6.0 J, P=0.0002, at 1.4 m
              s(-1)). Our findings demonstrate that 6DOF analysis (of
              hip-knee-ankle-foot) better captures energy changes of the body
              than more conventional 3DOF estimates. These findings refine our
              fundamental understanding of how work is distributed within the
              body, which has implications for assistive technology,
              biomechanical simulations and potentially clinical treatment.",

  abstract = "Previous studies of human locomotion indicate that foot and ankle
              structures can interact in complex ways. The structure of the
              foot defines the input and output lever arms that influences the
              force-generating capacity of the ankle plantar flexors during
              push-off. At the same time, deformation of the foot may dissipate
              some of the mechanical energy generated by the plantar flexors
              during push-off. We investigated this foot-ankle interplay during
              walking by adding stiffness to the foot through shoes and
              insoles, and characterized the resulting changes in in vivo
              soleus muscle-tendon mechanics using ultrasonography. Added
              stiffness decreased energy dissipation at the foot (p < 0.001)
              and increased the gear ratio (i.e., ratio of ground reaction
              force and plantar flexor muscle lever arms) (p < 0.001). Added
              foot stiffness also altered soleus muscle behaviour, leading to
              greater peak force (p < 0.001) and reduced fascicle shortening
              speed (p < 0.001). Despite this shift in force-velocity
              behaviour, the whole-body metabolic cost during walking increased
              with added foot stiffness (p < 0.001). This increased metabolic
              cost is likely due to the added force demand on the plantar
              flexors, as walking on a more rigid foot/shoe surface compromises
              the plantar flexors' mechanical advantage.",

  abstract = "SUMMARY: There is increasing interest in mapping and source
              reconstruction from electrocorticoencephalographic (ECoG) grid
              data and comparison to surface EEG evaluations of epileptic
              patients. ECoG mapping onto three-dimensional renderings of the
              individual cortical anatomy derived from magnetic resonance
              images and computed tomography (CT) is performed after
              coregistration of anatomical and functional coordinate systems.
              Source reconstructions from ECoG and EEG are compared using
              different source models and realistically shaped volume conductor
              models. Realistically shaped volume conductor models for EEG
              source reconstruction are a prerequisite for improved
              localization accuracy. Individual boundary element method (BEM)
              models derived from MRI represent the ``gold standard'' and can
              approximate isotropic homogeneous head compartments and thus give
              an improved description of the head shape as compared with
              classical oversimplifying spherical shell models. Anisotropic
              volume conduction properties of the bone layer or the white
              matter fibers can be described by the finite element method
              (FEM); unfortunately, these models require a huge computational
              effort and are thus not used in daily applications. To avoid this
              computational effort, head models derived from an averaged MRI
              dataset can be used. Highly refined models with a large number of
              nodes and thus better numerical accuracy can be used by this
              approach, because the setup is performed only once and the
              decomposed models or precomputed leadfield matrices are saved for
              later application. Individual image data are not at all needed,
              if an overlay of the reconstruction results with the anatomy is
              not desired. With precomputed leadfield matrices and linear
              interpolation techniques, at least standardized BEM and FEM
              volume conductor models derived from averaged MRI datasets can
              achieve the same computational speed as analytical spherical
              models. The smoothed cortical envelope is used as a realistically
              shaped single-shell volume conductor model for ECoG source
              reconstruction, whereas three-compartment BEM-models are required
              for EEG. The authors describe how to localize ECoG-grid electrode
              positions and how to segment the cortical surface from
              coregistered magnetic resonance and CT images. Landmark-based
              coregistration is performed using common fiducials in both image
              modalities. Another more promising automatic approach is based on
              mutual three-dimensional volume gray-level information. The ECoG
              electrode positions can be retrieved from three-dimensional CT
              slices manually using cursors in thresholded images with depth
              information. Alternatively, the smoothed envelope of the cortical
              surface segmented from the MRI is used to semiautomatically
              determine the grid electrode positions by marking the four
              corners and measuring distances along the smoothed surface. With
              extended source patches for cortically constrained scans and
              current density reconstructions, results from ECoG and surface
              EEG data were compared. Single equivalent dipoles were used to
              explain the EEG far fields, and results were compared with the
              original current density distributions explaining the ECoG data.
              The authors studied the performance of spherical and
              realistically shaped BEM volume conductor models for EEG and ECoG
              source reconstruction in spherical and nonspherical parts of the
              head with simulations and measured epileptic spike data. Only
              small differences between spherical and realistically shaped
              models were found in the spherical parts of the head, whereas
              realistically shaped models are superior to spherical
              approximations in both single-shell ECoG and three-shell EEG
              cases in the nonspherical parts, such as the temporal lobe areas.
              The ECoG near field is more complicated to interpret than the
              surface EEG far field and cannot be explained in general by
              simple equivalent dipoles. However, from simulations with
              realistically shaped volume conductor models and cortically
              constrained source models, the authors studied how the bone and
              skin layer act as spatial low pass filters that smooth and
              simplify the surface EEG maps generated by much more
              complicated-looking source configurations derived from measured
              ECoG data.",

  abstract = "AIM OF THE STUDY: An important goal for EEG-based functional
              brain studies is to estimate the location of brain sources that
              produce the scalp-recorded signals. Such source localization
              requires locating precisely the position of the EEG sensors. This
              review describes and compares different methods that are used for
              localizing EEG sensors. RESULTS: Five different methods have been
              described in literature. Manual methods consist in manual
              measurements to calculate the 3D coordinates of the sensors.
              Electromagnetic and ultrasound digitization permit localization
              by using trade devices. The photogrammetry system consists in
              taking pictures of the patient's head with the sensors. The last
              method consists in directly localizing the EEG sensors in the MRI
              volume. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The spatial localization of
              EEG sensors is an important step in performing source
              localization. This method should be accurate, fast, reproducible,
              and cheap. Currently, electromagnetic digitization is the most
              currently used method but MRI localization could be an
              interesting way because no additional method or device needs to
              be used to locate the EEG sensors.",

              include the results of a Monte-Carlo analysis which they
              performed to compare four non parametric algorithms and hence
              contribute to what is presently recorded in the literature. An
              extensive list of references to the work of other researchers is
              also provided. This paper starts off with a mathematical
              description of the inverse problem and proceeds to discuss the
              two main categories of methods which were developed to solve the
              EEG inverse problem, mainly the non parametric and parametric
              methods. The main difference between the two is to whether a
              fixed number of dipoles is assumed a priori or not. Various
              techniques falling within these categories are described
              including minimum norm estimates and their generalizations,
              LORETA, sLORETA, VARETA, S-MAP, ST-MAP, Backus-Gilbert, LAURA,
              Shrinking LORETA FOCUSS (SLF), SSLOFO and ALF for non parametric
              methods and beamforming techniques, BESA, subspace techniques
              such as MUSIC and methods derived from it, FINES, simulated
              annealing and computational intelligence algorithms for
              parametric methods. From a review of the performance of these
              techniques as documented in the literature, one could conclude
              that in most cases the LORETA solution gives satisfactory
              results. In situations involving clusters of dipoles, higher
              resolution algorithms such as MUSIC or FINES are however
              preferred. Imposing reliable biophysical and psychological
              constraints, as done by LAURA has given superior results. The
              Monte-Carlo analysis performed, comparing WMN, LORETA, sLORETA
              and SLF, for different noise levels and different simulated
              source depths has shown that for single source localization,
              regularized sLORETA gives the best solution in terms of both
              localization error and ghost sources. Furthermore the
              computationally intensive solution given by SLF was not found to
              give any additional benefits under such simulated conditions.",

              electromagnetic trackers (EMT) for the localization of electrodes
              and natural landmarks on the patient's head. MATERIALS AND
              METHODS: The effects of seven conditions on the measurement of
              the EMT were investigated with a Polhemus Fastrack: distance,
              contact between two components of the EMT, presence of magnetic
              object, localization of landmarks and electrodes on a phantom and
              a human subject without and with movements. RESULTS: The EMT has
              a precision of 0.15mm+/-0.36mm for the measurements made on still
              objects in a non-magnetic environment. On a human subject, the
              mean variation of the nasion position is 1.6mm+/-1.46mm and
              2.7mm+/-1.40mm for the tragus. The increase of the electrode

              homogeneous, were compared to a reference model, in which spongy
              and compact bone were explicitly accounted for. In both cases,
              isotropic and anisotropic conductivity assumptions were taken
              into account. We considered sources in the entire brain and
              determined errors both in the forward calculation and the

              whereas assuming isotropic or anisotropic skull conductivity has
              little influence. Moreover, we showed that, if using an isotropic

              skull conductivities should be considerably lower than the
              commonly used 80:1. For skull modeling, we recommend (1) Local
              models: if compact and spongy bone can be identified with
              sufficient accuracy (e.g., from MRI) and their conductivities can
              be assumed to be known (e.g., from measurements), one should
              model these explicitly by assigning each voxel to one of the two

              the usual 0.0042 S/m, or as homogeneous and anisotropic, but with

              brain physiology and pathology. Here we assess whether valid
              localizations of coherent cortical networks can also be obtained
              from high-resolution electroencephalography (EEG) recordings.
              METHODS: EEG was recorded from healthy subjects and from patients
              with ischemic brain lesions during a tonic hand muscle
              contraction task and during continuous visual stimulation with an
              alternating checkerboard. These tasks induce oscillations in the
              primary hand motor area or in the primary visual cortex,
              respectively, which are coherent with extracerebral signals (hand
              muscle electromyogram or visual stimulation frequency). Cortical
              oscillations were reconstructed with different inverse solutions
              and the coherence between oscillations at each cortical voxel and
              the extracerebral signals was calculated. Moreover, simulations
              of coherent point sources were performed. RESULTS:
              Cortico-muscular coherence was correctly localized to the primary
              hand motor area and the steady-state visual evoked potentials to
              the primary visual cortex in all subjects and patients.
              Sophisticated head models tended to yield better localization
              accuracy than a single sphere model. A Minimum Variance
              Beamformer (MVBF) provided more accurate and focal localizations
              of simulated point sources than an L2 Minimum Norm (MN) inverse
              solution. In the real datasets, the MN maps had less localization

  abstract = "For about six decades, primary current sources of the
              electroencephalogram (EEG) have been assumed dipolar in nature.
              In this study, we used electrophysiological recordings from
              anesthetized Wistar rats undergoing repeated whisker deflections
              to revise the biophysical foundations of the EEG dipolar model.
              In a first experiment, we performed three-dimensional recordings
              of extracellular potentials from a large portion of the barrel
              field to estimate intracortical multipolar moments generated
              either by single spiking neurons (i.e., pyramidal cells, PC;
              spiny stellate cells, SS) or by populations of them while
              experiencing synchronized postsynaptic potentials. As expected,
              backpropagating spikes along PC dendrites caused dipolar field
              components larger in the direction perpendicular to the cortical
              surface (49.7 $\pm$ 22.0 nA·mm). In agreement with the fact that
              SS cells have ``close-field'' configurations, their dipolar
              moment at any direction was negligible. Surprisingly, monopolar
              field components were detectable both at the level of single
              units (i.e., -11.7 $\pm$ 3.4 nA for PC) and at the mesoscopic
              level of mixed neuronal populations receiving extended synaptic
              inputs within either a cortical column (-0.44 $\pm$ 0.20 $\mu$A)
              or a 2.5-m(3)-voxel volume (-3.32 $\pm$ 1.20 $\mu$A). To evaluate
              the relationship between the macroscopically defined EEG
              equivalent dipole and the mesoscopic intracortical multipolar
              moments, we performed concurrent recordings of high-resolution
              skull EEG and laminar local field potentials. From this second
              experiment, we estimated the time-varying EEG equivalent dipole
              for the entire barrel field using either a multiple dipole
              fitting or a distributed type of EEG inverse solution. We
              demonstrated that mesoscopic multipolar components are altogether
              absorbed by any equivalent dipole in both types of inverse
              solutions. We conclude that the primary current sources of the
              EEG in the neocortex of rodents are not precisely represented by
              a single equivalent dipole and that the existence of monopolar
              components must be also considered at the mesoscopic level.",

              electrode positions produced by single current dipoles of a 3-D

              estimated using gradient descent within five template head models
              fit to the electrode positions. These were: a spherical model,
              three-layer and four-layer BEM head models based on the Montreal
              Neurological Institute (MNI) template head image, and these BEM
              models warped to the recorded electrode positions. Smallest

              established by placing the cap on a reference head and digitizing
              the 3-D position of each channel. A set of control channels are
              pre-selected that should be adequately distributed over the cap.
              A simple choice could be the standard 19 channels of the

  abstract = "Inaccuracy of EEG electrode coordinates forms an error term in
              forward model generation and ultimate source reconstruction

              intrinsic measurement noise of the digitization apparatus and
              manual coregistration error when selecting corresponding points
              on anatomical MRI volumes. A common assumption is that such an
              error would lead only to displacement of localized sources. Here,
              we measured electrode positions on a 3D-printed full-scale
              replica head, using three different techniques: a fringe
              projection 3D scanner, a novel ``Flying Triangulation'' 3D
              sensor, and a traditional electromagnetic digitizer. Using highly
              accurate fringe projection data as ground truth, the Flying
              Triangulation sensor had a mean error of 1.5 mm while the
              electromagnetic digitizer had a mean error of 6.8 mm. Then, again
              using the fringe projection as ground truth, individual EEG
              simulations were generated, with source locations across the
              brain space and a range of sensor noise levels. The simulated

              with the electrode coordinates registered with the Flying
              Triangulation and electromagnetic digitizer methods. The
              beamformer's output SNR was severely degraded with the
              digitizer-based positions but less severely with the Flying
              Triangulation coordinates. Therefore, the seemingly innocuous
              error in electrode registration may result in substantial
              degradation of beamformer performance, with output SNR penalties
              up to several decibels. In the case of low-SNR signals such as
              deeper brain structures or gamma band sources, this implies that
              sensor coregistration accuracy could make the difference between

  abstract = "Electroencephalography (EEG) is often used in source analysis
              studies, in which the locations of cortex regions responsible for
              a signal are determined. For this to be possible, accurate
              positions of the electrodes at the scalp surface must be
              determined, otherwise errors in the source estimation will occur.
              Today, several methods for acquiring these positions exist but
              they are often not satisfyingly accurate or take a long time to
              perform. Therefore, in this paper we describe a method capable of
              determining the positions accurately and fast. This method uses
              an infrared light motion capture system (IR-MOCAP) with 8 cameras
              arranged around a human participant. It acquires 3D coordinates
              of each electrode and automatically labels them. Each electrode
              has a small reflector on top of it thus allowing its detection by
              the cameras. We tested the accuracy of the presented method by
              acquiring the electrodes positions on a rigid sphere model and
              comparing these with measurements from computer tomography (CT).
              The average Euclidean distance between the sphere model CT

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Source localization algorithms often show multiple
              active cortical areas as the source of electroencephalography
              (EEG). Yet, there is little data quantifying the accuracy of
              these results. In this paper, the performance of current source
              density source localization algorithms for the detection of
              multiple cortical sources of EEG data has been characterized.
              METHODS: EEG data were generated by simulating multiple cortical
              sources (2-4) with the same strength or two sources with relative
              strength ratios of 1:1 to 4:1, and adding noise. These data were
              used to reconstruct the cortical sources using current source
              density (CSD) algorithms: sLORETA, MNLS, and LORETA using a
              p-norm with p equal to 1, 1.5 and 2. Precision (percentage of the
              reconstructed activity corresponding to simulated activity) and
              Recall (percentage of the simulated sources reconstructed) of
              each of the CSD algorithms were calculated. RESULTS: While
              sLORETA has the best performance when only one source is present,
              when two or more sources are present LORETA with p equal to 1.5
              performs better. When the relative strength of one of the sources
              is decreased, all algorithms have more difficulty reconstructing
              that source. However, LORETA 1.5 continues to outperform other
              algorithms. If only the strongest source is of interest sLORETA
              is recommended, while LORETA with p equal to 1.5 is recommended
              if two or more of the cortical sources are of interest. These
              results provide guidance for choosing a CSD algorithm to locate
              multiple cortical sources of EEG and for interpreting the results
              of these algorithms.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Accurate knowledge about the positions of electrodes
              in electroencephalography (EEG) is very important for precise
              source localizations. Direct detection of electrodes from
              magnetic resonance (MR) images is particularly interesting, as it
              is possible to avoid errors of co-registration between electrode
              and head coordinate systems. In this study, we propose an
              automated MR-based method for electrode detection and labeling,
              particularly tailored to high-density montages. APPROACH:
              Anatomical MR images were processed to create an
              electrode-enhanced image in individual space. Image processing
              included intensity non-uniformity correction, background noise
              and goggles artifact removal. Next, we defined a search volume
              around the head where electrode positions were detected.
              Electrodes were identified as local maxima in the search volume
              and registered to the Montreal Neurological Institute standard
              space using an affine transformation. This allowed the matching
              of the detected points with the specific EEG montage template, as
              well as their labeling. Matching and labeling were performed by
              the coherent point drift method. Our method was assessed on 8 MR
              images collected in subjects wearing a 256-channel EEG net, using
              the displacement with respect to manually selected electrodes as
              performance metric. MAIN RESULTS: Average displacement achieved
              by our method was significantly lower compared to alternative
              techniques, such as the photogrammetry technique. The maximum
              displacement was for more than 99\% of the electrodes lower than
              1 cm, which is typically considered an acceptable upper limit for
              errors in electrode positioning. Our method showed robustness and
              reliability, even in suboptimal conditions, such as in the case
              of net rotation, imprecisely gathered wires, electrode detachment
              from the head, and MR image ghosting. SIGNIFICANCE: We showed
              that our method provides objective, repeatable and precise
              estimates of EEG electrode coordinates. We hope our work will
              contribute to a more widespread use of high-density EEG as a
              brain-imaging tool.",

              the increasing use of advanced head modeling techniques that take
              advantage of MRI together with the precise positions of the
              recording electrodes. The prevailing technique for registering
              EEG electrode coordinates involves electromagnetic digitization.
              However, the procedure adds several minutes to experiment
              preparation and typical digitizers may not be accurate enough for
              optimal source reconstruction performance (Dalal et al., 2014).
              Here, we present a rapid, accurate, and cost-effective
              alternative method to register EEG electrode positions, using a
              single digital SLR camera, photogrammetry software, and computer
              vision techniques implemented in our open-source toolbox,
              janus3D. Our approach uses photogrammetry to construct 3D models
              from multiple photographs of the participant's head wearing the
              EEG electrode cap. Electrodes are detected automatically or
              semi-automatically using a template. The rigid facial features
              from these photo-based models are then surface-matched to
              MRI-based head reconstructions to facilitate coregistration to
              MRI space. This method yields a final electrode coregistration
              error of 0.8 mm, while a standard technique using an
              electromagnetic digitizer yielded an error of 6.1 mm. The
              technique furthermore reduces preparation time, and could be
              extended to a multi-camera array, which would make the procedure
              virtually instantaneous. In addition to EEG, the technique could
              likewise capture the position of the fiducial markers used in
              magnetoencephalography systems to register head position.",

              visual inspection and palpation, inducing intersession variations
              in their determined locations due to structural ambiguity or poor

              electrode placement according to the 10/20 system, affixed

              For subsequent procedures, the laser scan is conducted likewise

              following the measurement of fiducial electrode locations, frame

              repeatable electrode positioning is essential for reliable EEG
              assessment. Conventional methods use anatomical landmarks as
              fiducial locations for the electrode placement. Since the
              landmarks are manually identified, the EEG assessment is
              inevitably unreliable because of individual variations among the
              subjects and the examiners. To overcome this unreliability, an
              augmented reality (AR) visualization-based electrode guidance
              system was proposed. METHODS: The proposed electrode guidance
              system is based on AR visualization to replace the manual
              electrode positioning. After scanning and registration of the
              facial surface of a subject by an RGB-D camera, the AR of the
              initial electrode positions as reference positions is overlapped
              with the current electrode positions in real time. Thus, it can

              These measurements have been extremely time consuming because of
              the difficulty in obtaining repeatable constant speed trials
              (particularly with animals). We have overcome this difficulty by
              mounting a force platform directly under the belt of a motorized

              from an unlimited number of successive ground contacts in a much
              shorter time. With this treadmill-mounted force platform it is

              were >178 Hz for Fz and >87 Hz for Fy, i.e., well above the
              signal content of these ground-reaction forces. Mechanical tests
              and comparisons with data obtained from a force platform runway
              indicated that the force treadmill recorded Fz, Fy, Mx and My
              ground-reaction forces and moments accurately. Although the
              lowest natural frequency of vibration was 88 Hz for Fx, the
              signal-to-noise ratios for Fx and Mz were unacceptable. This
              device greatly decreases the time and laboratory space required
              for locomotion experiments and clinical evaluations. The modular
              design allows for independent use of both treadmill and force
              platform.",

  abstract = "In human walking, the center of mass motion is similar to an
              inverted pendulum. Viewing double support as a transition from
              one inverted pendulum to the next, we hypothesized that the
              leading leg performs negative work to redirect the center of mass
              velocity, while simultaneously, the trailing leg performs
              positive work to replace the lost energy. To test this
              hypothesis, we developed a method to quantify the external
              mechanical work performed by each limb (individual limbs method).
              Traditional measures of external mechanical work use the sum of
              the ground reaction forces acting on the limbs (combined limbs
              method) allowing for the mathematical cancellation of
              simultaneous positive and negative work during multiple support
              periods. We expected to find that the traditional combined limbs
              method underestimates external mechanical work by a substantial
              amount. We used both methods to measure the external mechanical
              work performed by humans walking over a range of speeds. We found
              that during double support, the legs perform a substantial amount
              of positive and negative external work simultaneously. The
              combined limbs measures of positive and negative external work
              were approximately 33\% less than those calculated using the
              individual limbs method. At all speeds, the trailing leg performs
              greater than 97\% of the double support positive work while the

              situations is that the vertical projection of the centre of mass
              (CoM) should be within the base of support (BoS). On the basis of
              a simple inverted pendulum model, an extension of this rule is
              proposed for dynamical situations: the position of (the vertical
              projection of) the CoM plus its velocity times a factor l/g
              should be within the BoS, l being leg length and g the

  title    = "Direction-dependent control of balance during walking and

  author   = "O'Connor, Shawn M and Kuo, Arthur D",
  abstract = "Human walking has previously been described as ``controlled
              falling.'' Some computational models, however, suggest that gait
              may also have self-stabilizing aspects requiring little CNS
              control. The fore-aft component of walking may even be passively
              stable from step to step, whereas lateral motion may be unstable
              and require motor control for balance, as through active foot
              placement. If this is the case, walking humans might rely less on
              integrative sensory feedback, such as vision, for anteroposterior
              (AP) than for mediolateral (ML) balance. We tested whether
              healthy humans (n=10) exhibit such direction-dependent control,
              by applying low-frequency perturbations to the visual field (a
              projected virtual hallway) and measuring foot placement during
              treadmill walking. We found step variability to be nearly 10
              times more sensitive to ML than to AP perturbations, as
              quantified by the increase in root-mean-square step variability
              per unit change in perturbation amplitude. This is not simply due
              to poorer physiological sensitivity of vision in the AP
              direction: similar perturbations applied to quiet standing
              produced reversed direction dependence, with an AP sensitivity
              2.3-fold greater than that of ML. Tandem (heel-to-toe) standing
              yielded ML sensitivity threefold greater than that of AP,
              suggesting that the base of support influences the stability of
              standing. Postural balance nevertheless appears to require
              continuous, integrative motor control for balance in all
              directions. In contrast, walking balance requires step-by-step,
              integrative control for balance, but mainly in the lateral
              direction. In the fore-aft direction, balance may be maintained
              through an ``uncontrolled,'' yet passively stabilized, series of
              falls.",

  author   = "Malone, Laura A and Bastian, Amy J",
  abstract = "Control of the human walking pattern normally requires little
              thought, with conscious control used only in the face of a
              challenging environment or a perturbation. We have previously
              shown that people can adapt spatial and temporal aspects of
              walking to a sustained perturbation generated by a split-belt
              treadmill. Here we tested whether conscious correction of
              walking, versus distraction from it, modifies adaptation.
              Conscious correction of stepping may expedite the adaptive
              process and help to form a new walking pattern. However, because
              walking is normally an automatic process, it is possible that
              conscious effort could interfere with adaptation, whereas
              distraction might improve it by removing competing voluntary
              control. Three groups of subjects were studied: a control group
              was given no specific instructions, a conscious correction group
              was instructed how to step and given intermittent visual feedback
              of stepping during adaptation, and a distraction group performed
              a dual-task during adaptation. After adaptation, retention of
              aftereffects was assessed in all groups during normal treadmill
              walking without conscious effort, feedback, or distraction. We
              found that conscious correction speeds adaptation, whereas
              distraction slows it. Subjects trained with distraction retained
              aftereffects longest, suggesting that the training used during
              adaptation predicts the time course of deadaptation. An
              unexpected finding was that these manipulations affected the
              adaptation rate of spatial but not temporal elements of walking.
              Thus conscious processes can preferentially access the spatial
              walking pattern. It may be that spatial and temporal controls of
              locomotion are accessible through distinct neural circuits, with
              the former being most sensitive to conscious effort or
              distraction.",

              energetic cost and vary step width from step-to-step to maintain
              lateral balance. Arm swing also reduces energetic cost and
              improves lateral balance. In running, humans prefer a narrow step
              width that may present a challenge for maintaining lateral
              balance. However, arm swing in running may improve lateral
              balance and help reduce energetic cost. To understand the roles
              of step width and arm swing, we hypothesized that net metabolic
              power would be greater at step widths greater or less than
              preferred and when running without arm swing. We further
              hypothesized that step width variability (indicator of lateral
              balance) would be greater at step widths greater or less than
              preferred and when running without arm swing. Ten subjects ran
              (3m/s) at four target step widths (0\%, 15\%, 20\%, and 25\% leg
              length (LL)) with arm swing, at their preferred step width with
              arm swing, and at their preferred step width without arm swing.
              We measured metabolic power, step width, and step width
              variability. When subjects ran at target step widths less (0\%
              LL) or greater (15\%, 20\%, and 25\% LL) than preferred, both net
              metabolic power demand (by 3\%, 9\%, 12\%, and 15\%) and step
              width variability (by 7\%, 33\%, 46\%, and 69\%) increased. When
              running without arm swing, both net metabolic power demand (by
              8\%) and step width variability (by 9\%) increased compared to
              running with arm swing. It appears that humans prefer to run with
              a narrow step width and swing their arms so as to minimize
              energetic cost and improve lateral balance.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Understanding how stability and/or maneuverability
              affects motor control strategies can provide insight on moving
              about safely in an unpredictable world. Stability in human
              movement has been well-studied while maneuverability has not.
              Further, a tradeoff between stability and maneuverability during
              movement seems apparent, yet has not been quantified. We proposed
              that greater maneuverability, the ability to rapidly and
              purposefully change movement direction and speed, is beneficial
              in uncertain environments. We also hypothesized that gaining
              maneuverability comes at the expense of stability and perhaps
              also corresponds with decreased muscle coactivation. MATERIALS
              AND METHODS: We used a goal-directed forward lean movement task
              that integrated both stability and maneuverability. Subjects (n =
              11) used their center of pressure to control a cursor on a
              computer monitor to reach a target. We added task uncertainty by
              shifting the target anterior-posterior position mid-movement. We
              used a balance board with a narrow beam that reduced the base of
              support in the medio-lateral direction and defined stability as
              the probability that subjects could keep the balance board level
              during the task. RESULTS: During the uncertainty condition,
              subjects were able to change direction of their
              anterior-posterior center of pressure more rapidly, indicating
              that subjects were more maneuverable. Furthermore, medio-lateral
              center of pressure excursions also approached the edges of the
              beam and reduced stability margins, implying that subjects were
              less stable (i.e. less able to keep the board level). On the
              narrow beam board, subjects increased muscle coactivation of
              lateral muscle pairs and had greater muscle activity in the left
              leg. However, there were no statistically significant differences
              in muscle activity amplitudes or coactivation with uncertainty.
              CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results demonstrate that there is
              a tradeoff between stability and maneuverability during a
              goal-directed whole-body movement. Tasks with added uncertainty
              could help individuals learn to be more maneuverable yet
              sufficiently stable.",

              overcome this reduced ankle push-off, energy-storing, spring-like
              carbon-composite Ankle Foot Orthoses (AFO) can be prescribed. It
              is expected that the energy returned by the AFO in late stance
              will support ankle push-off, and reduce the energy cost of
              walking. In 10 patients with multiple sclerosis and stroke the
              energy cost of walking, 3D kinematics, joint power, and joint
              work were measured during gait, with and without the AFO. The

              and used to calculate the contribution of the AFO to the ankle
              kinetics. We found a significant decrease of 9.8\% in energy cost
              of walking when walking with the AFO. With the AFO, the range of
              motion of the ankle was reduced by 12.3°, and the net work around

              positive ankle work, which reduced the total amount of work
              performed by the leg by 11.1\% when walking with the AFO. The
              decrease in energy cost when walking with a spring-like

              Mean MOS(ml) were consistently slightly larger during all

              stimulus cue, such as a light turned on or off, or if there are
              differences in response to these cues during a muscle contraction
              task compared with a muscle relaxation task. The objective of
              this study was to assess the response time of a relaxation task,
              including the contraction portion of the task, to a stimulus of a
              light turned on or off. In addition, we investigated the effect
              of the pre-contraction level on the relaxation task. RESULTS:
              Contraction response time was significantly shorter during the
              light-on status than during the light-off status (P <0.01), and
              relaxation response time in each maximum voluntary contraction
              was significantly longer during the light-on status than during
              the light-off status (P <0.01). The relaxation response time
              became longer in order of 25\% to 75\% maximum voluntary
              contraction regardless of light-on or -off status, and was
              significantly longer than the contraction response time (P
              <0.05-0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study found that as the
              contraction level increased, the relaxation response time became
              longer than the contraction response time regardless of light
              status. However, contraction response time or relaxation response
              time findings were opposite to this during the light-on status
              and light-off status: contraction response time became shorter in
              the light-on status than in the light-off status and relaxation
              response time became longer in the light-on status than in the
              light-off status. These results suggest that the length of each
              response time is affected by motor control in the higher order
              brain and involves specific processing in the visual system.",

              human-machine interface, has to be designed properly to achieve
              satisfactory load transmission, stability, and efficient control
              for mobility. The biomechanical understanding of the interaction
              between prosthetic socket and the residual limb is fundamental to
              such goals. The purpose of this paper is to review the recent
              research literature on socket biomechanics, including socket
              pressure measurement, friction-related phenomena and associated
              properties, computational modeling, and limb tissue responses to

              understanding has advanced the science of socket fitting.
              However, the most recent advances in the understanding of
              stresses experienced at the residual limb have not yet led to
              enough clinical consensus that could fundamentally alter clinical

              major discrepancies. Further research should be directed to
              address the critical controversies and the associated technical
              challenges. Developments should be guided to offer clinicians the

              the friction/slip conditions and pre-stresses applied on the limb
              within a rectified socket. The residual limb and socket were

              limb penetrated into the socket because of socket modification.
              In the first step of the simulation, the penetrated limb surface
              was moved onto the inner surface of the socket and the
              pre-stresses were predicted. In the subsequent loading step,
              pre-stresses were kept and loadings were applied at the knee

              Comparisons were made between the model using the proposed

              sliding are highly nonlinear. With a less stiff liner, the slide
              distance of the stump would increase with a larger contact area.
              However, this increase in the contact area would not ensure a
              reduction in the peak interface stress and this is due to the

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Monolimb is a transtibial prosthesis having the
              socket and shank molded into one piece of thermoplastic material.
              If properly designed, the shank of a monolimb can have a
              controlled deflection during walking which simulates the ankle
              joint motions to some extent. However, there is no clear guidance
              for the design of monolimb considering the dilemma between shank
              flexibility and structural integrity. METHODS: Finite element
              analysis was used to simulate structural tests based on ISO10328
              on monolimbs of different configurations. Statistics-based
              Taguchi method was employed to identify the significance of each
              design factor in controlling the deformation and stress within
              monolimbs. The design factors considered were the thickness of
              the thermoplastics, anteroposterior and medialateral dimensions
              of the elliptical shank, and depth of the posterior seam line. By
              progressively fine-tuning the design factors, the monolimb
              configuration was optimized giving offering appropriate
              flexibilities of the shank and would not structurally fail in
              normal uses. Experimental structural test was used to validate
              the finite element model. FINDINGS: Anteroposterior dimension of
              the shank was shown to be the most important design factor
              determining the peak von Mises stress values, deformation and
              dorsiflexion angles of monolimbs. Depth of seam line appears much
              less important than the other three factors. A monolimb
              fulfilling the design requirements was suggested. Experimental
              test results reasonably matched with the finite element results.
              INTERPRETATION: Finite element analysis and Taguchi method was
              shown to be an effective method in optimizing the structural
              design of prostheses. Further prosthetic design can be
              facilitated based on the degree of importance of the design
              factors on the structural behavior of the prosthesis. Gait
              analysis of amputees using the suggested monolimb design is
              needed in the future.",

              have been restricted to unsupported stance and natural gait, i.e.
              walking at a comfortable speed on flat and straight walkway.
              However, the pressure behaviour as to the interface in unilateral
              transtibial amputees during walking on stairs, slope and non-flat
              road is unclear. METHODS: Pressure distribution changes at
              multiple points, expressed as mean peak stump/socket interface
              pressure, mean pressure level over 90\% of peak pressure, time in
              which pressure exceeded 90\% of peak pressure and time-pressure
              integral at the period of sustained sub-maximal load, were
              measured during natural ambulating and walking on stairs, slope
              and non-flat road. FINDINGS: Compared with natural gait, the mean
              peak pressure and sustained sub-maximal load increase notably
              over the patellar tendon during walking on stairs and non-flat
              road, and however decrease or change insignificantly at the
              patellar tendon on slope and over other measured areas in all
              conditions; moreover the time period of sustained sub-maximal
              load changes remarkably, except over the patellar tendon during
              walking up slope and over the popliteal area on non-flat road;
              finally, the time-pressure integral in the time period of
              sustained sub-maximal load changes considerably, except at the
              patellar tendon during walking up slope. INTERPRETATION: The
              pressure characteristics during natural ambulating seem not to be
              highly predictive of what occurs in the conditions of walking on
              stairs, slope and non-flat road, which leads to significant
              increase in amplitude domain of tissue loading only at the
              patellar tendon, and however to remarkable changes in temporal
              sequences of tissue (un-)loading almost in all measured regions.",

  abstract = "Active transtibial amputation (TTA) patients are at risk for
              developing pressure ulcers (PU) and deep tissue injury (DTI)
              while using their prosthesis. It is therefore important to obtain
              knowledge of the mechanical state in the internal soft tissues of
              the residuum, as well as knowledge of the mechanical state upon
              its surface. Our aim was to apply patient-specific MRI-based
              non-linear finite element (FE) models to quantify internal
              strains in TTA prosthetic users (n=5) during load-bearing. By
              further employing a strain injury threshold for skeletal muscle,
              we identified patients susceptible to DTI. The geometrical
              characteristics of the residuum of the TTA participants varied
              substantially between patients, e.g. the residuum lengths were
              7.6, 8.1, 9.2, 11.5 and 13.3cm. We generally found that internal
              strains were higher in the bone proximity than in the muscle flap
              periphery. The highest strains, which in some patients exceeded
              50\% (engineering strain) for compressive, tensile and shear
              strains, were found in the shortest residual limbs, i.e. the 7.6
              and 8.1cm-long limbs. Correspondingly, the lowest strains were
              found in the 13.3cm-long residuum, which had the bulkiest muscle
              flap. Yet, even in the case of a long residuum, about a third of
              the soft tissue volume at the distal tibial proximity area was
              occupied by large (>5\%) internal compressive, tensile and shear
              strains. For both patients with shorter residual limbs, the
              internal principal compressive strains above 5\% occupied almost
              the entire distal tibial proximity area. For a patient whose
              distal tibial end was flat (non-beveled), internal strains were
              more uniformly distributed, compared to the strain distributions
              in the other models, where focal elevated strains accumulated in
              the bone proximity. We found no muscle strains above the
              immediate injury threshold, indicating that all patients were not
              at immediate risk for DTI. Two patients whose residuum fat
              padding was minimal to none, were the only ones identified as
              theoretically prone to DTI at long (>3h) continuous
              weight-bearing periods. We conclude that there is a wide
              variability in internal mechanical conditions between residual
              limbs across subjects, which necessitates patient-specific
              quantitative analyses of internal mechanical states in TTA
              patients, to assess the mechanical performance of the
              reconstructed limb and in particular, the individual risk for
              deep PU or DTI.",

  author   = "Fey, Nicholas P and Klute, Glenn K and Neptune, Richard R",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Below-knee amputees commonly experience asymmetrical
              gait patterns and develop comorbidities in their intact and
              residual legs. Carbon fiber prosthetic feet have been developed
              to minimize these asymmetries by utilizing elastic energy storage
              and return to provide body support, forward propulsion and leg
              swing initiation. However, how prosthetic foot stiffness
              influences walking characteristics is not well-understood. The
              purpose of this study was to identify the influence of foot
              stiffness on kinematics, kinetics, muscle activity, prosthetic
              energy storage and return, and mechanical efficiency during
              amputee walking. METHODS: A comprehensive biomechanical analysis
              was performed on 12 unilateral below-knee amputees. Subjects
              walked overground at 1.2 m/s with three prosthetic feet of
              varying keel and heel stiffness levels, which were created using
              additive manufacturing. FINDINGS: As stiffness decreased, peak
              residual and intact leg ankle angles and residual leg knee
              flexion angle increased. The residual and intact leg braking
              ground reaction forces and knee extensor moments, residual leg
              vastus and gluteus medius activity, and intact leg vastus and
              rectus femoris activity also increased. The second vertical
              ground reaction force peak and hamstring activity in the residual
              leg and first vertical ground reaction force peak in the intact
              leg decreased. In addition, prosthetic energy storage and return
              increased and mechanical efficiency decreased as stiffness
              decreased. INTERPRETATION: Decreasing foot stiffness can increase
              prosthesis range of motion, mid-stance energy storage and
              late-stance energy return, but the net contributions to forward
              propulsion and swing initiation may be limited as additional
              muscle activity to provide body support becomes necessary.",

              course of WSS and its response to postural changes and exercise
              along the SFA of healthy adults. METHODS: In forty-six healthy
              subjects, we determined flow velocities and internal vessel
              diameters in five predefined segments of the SFA using duplex
              ultrasound; measurements were done at rest, following exercise
              (30 toe raises) and after postural changes (supine and sitting).
              Peak and mean WSS were calculated from peak systolic and mean
              velocities, vessel diameter and whole blood viscosity. RESULTS:
              At rest, peak and mean WSS did not vary along the
              femoro-popliteal axis (p > 0.05); peak and mean WSS were lower in
              the sitting than in the supine position (p < 0.0001). After
              exercise, peak and mean WSS increased in all segments (p <
              0.0001), showing the lowest increase in the distal Hunter's
              canal. CONCLUSION: Healthy adults do not exhibit local variations
              of WSS in the SFA at rest, but segmental differences in WSS occur
              after exercise. Whether these findings are related to the typical

  abstract  = "Purpose: Many trans-tibial amputees could not tolerate
               long-distance walking. Lack of walking could explain for the
               increased cardiovascular diseases mortality rate. This study
               investigated the effects of long-distance walking (LDW) on
               socket-limb interface pressure, tactile sensitivity of the
               residual limb, and subjective feedbacks, which potentially
               identified the difficulties in LDW. Method: Five male unilateral
               trans-tibial amputees walked on a level treadmill for a total of
               one hour at comfortable speed. Tactile sensitivity of the
               residual limb and socket-limb interface pressure during
               over-ground walking were measured before and after the treadmill
               walking. Modified Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaires were also
               administered. Results: After the treadmill walking, the
               socket-limb interface pressure and the tactile sensitivity at
               the popliteal depression area were significantly reduced. This
               corresponds well with the questionnaire results showing that the
               level of discomfort and pain of the residual limb did not
               increase. The questionnaire revealed that there were significant
               increases in fatigue level at the sound-side plantar flexors,
               which could lead to impaired dynamic stability. Conclusions:
               Fatigue of sound-side plantar-flexor was the main difficulty
               faced by the five subjects when walking long-distances. This
               finding might imply the importance of refining prosthetic
               components and rehabilitation protocols in reducing the muscle
               fatigue.Implications for RehabilitationAfter long-distance
               walking (LDW) of the trans-tibal amputee subjects, there were
               significant increases in fatigue level at the plantar flexors.
               These might explain the reduced walking stability as perceived
               by the subjects.LDW did not produce any problems in
               residual-limb comfort and pain feeling. These were in line with
               the significant reductions of socket-limb interface pressure and
               the tactile sensitivity at the popliteal depression after
               LDW.Refinements of prosthetic components and rehabilitation

              the feet about the ankle joints while the subject stood on a
              force measuring platform. Ankle muscle activity and torque were
              monitored as upright stance was reestablished, and correlated
              with head angular accelerations and neck muscle activity. In
              normals with eyes closed, soleus stretch reflex activity at
              50--80 ms was followed by two bursts of tibialis anterior (TA)
              EMG activity at ca 80 and 125 ms from the onset of 36 deg/s, 3
              deg amplitude platform rotations. Neck muscle activity rotated
              the head backwards at the same time as TA activity rotated the
              body forwards about the ankle joints. Under the influence of
              vision, i.e. eyes open, slight increases in the second burst of
              TA activity, and ankle torque were observed. When the subjects
              sat, and were instructed to activate TA rapidly on onset of the
              platform movement, TA EMG activity increased gradually at ca. 150
              ms and not as a burst. In patients with long-lasting bilateral
              vestibular deficits, both bursts of TA activity were
              significantly less than normal with eyes closed. Consequently
              sway correcting torques were abnormally low and all but one of
              the patients fell over backwards. With eyes open, TA activity was
              slightly less than, and ankle torques were approximately equal to
              normal values. In contrast to normals, TA responses obtained in
              standing and sitting positions were not significantly different.
              Neck EMG activity varied from normal, consisting of a long burst
              100 ms in duration. The present data indicate that a coordinated
              pattern of ankle, and neck muscle activity occurs during the
              first 150 ms following induced backward tilt. Ankle muscle
              activity corrects for the body sway, and neck muscle activity
              attempts to stabilise the head with respect to earth fixed
              coordinates. It is proposed that the vestibulo-spinal reflex
              system predominantly underlies the genesis and coordination of
              this muscle activity.",

  author   = "Allum, J H and Honegger, F and Schicks, H",
  abstract = "One way of investigating different muscle synergies underlying
              human balance control is to assume that only 1 or 2 centrally
              preprogrammed synergies are available to reestablish upright
              stance when it is perturbed. According to this hypothesis, the
              many, apparently different, synergies elicited by rotation or
              translation of a support-surface on which test subjects stand, in
              fact, result from a modulation of muscle responses induced by
              different amplitudes of afferent inputs. To test this hypothesis,
              we probed the balance control of 16 normal subjects with 5
              combinations of rotation and translation of the support surface.
              Each combination yielded a constant angle (3 or 4 degrees) and
              angular velocity (18 and 36 degrees/s, respectively) over the
              first 120 ms of ankle dorsiflexion but resulted in differing
              velocities of upper leg, trunk, and head movements. These first
              120 ms of link movements and the resulting muscle responses were
              analysed for amplitude and timing modulation using 3 techniques.
              First, velocities of initial link movements and areas of muscle
              EMG activity were examined separately for the minimum number of
              descriptors, which would optimally describe the linear variation
              of the interlink amplitude synergy with respect to the amount of
              support-surface rotation or translation employed to perturb
              balance. Initial trunk angular velocity, which was highly
              correlated with head linear acceleration (r = 0.9), provided the
              first best descriptor of initial link movements. Ankle angular
              velocity provided the second descriptor because it was not
              correlated with trunk angular velocity. The amplitude modulation
              synergy of EMG responses could be characterised by the modulation
              of tibialis anterior and paraspinal muscles between 160 and 240
              ms and by that of soleus between 80 and 120 ms after stimulus
              onset. The linear combination of these best descriptors of link
              movements and that for EMG response amplitudes changed
              continuously in an identical manner with changes in the stimulus
              combination. Second, multivariate linear correlations between the
              amplitudes of initial link velocities and muscle EMG response
              areas best describing the response amplitude synergy were
              examined. Several significant correlations (r > 0.6) were
              obtained between leg and trunk muscle activity 120 ms after
              stimulus onset and trunk, or upper leg angular velocity, or head
              linear velocity, prior to 120 ms. Finally, crosscorrelations
              between muscle responses were examined for consistent interlink
              timing synergies between muscle responses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT

              When analyzing a measured movement with an inverse dynamics

              measuring errors and deviations of the segments model from

  abstract = "We analyzed the standing balance control of 11 healthy subjects
              and 15 subjects with bilateral vestibular hypofunction (BVH)
              using phase plane (velocity versus displacement) plots. We
              hypothesized that maintaining postural stability requires control
              of both the position and momentum of the center of gravity (CG)
              and infer that it is advantageous to use both velocity and
              displacement data to characterize balance control. Phase plane
              plots provide insight into this dynamic aspect of balance
              control. We evaluated phase plane plots based on whole body CG
              and center of pressure (CoP). We varied stability by altering the
              base of support and visual information. Three different foot
              placements were used: feet wide apart, feet together, and
              semitandem stance. Feet together standing was performed with eyes
              open and with eyes closed. The phase plane plots show changes in
              stability as base of support is altered or visual input is
              removed and reveal stability differences between the control and
              BVH groups. The root mean square variance of velocity and
              displacement was used to quantify the phase plane information.
              This parameter showed significant differences between activities
              and between groups. We conclude that phase plane plots that

@ARTICLE{Winter1995-qn,
  title    = "Human balance and posture control during standing and walking",
  author   = "Winter, D A",
  abstract = "The common denominator in the assessment of human balance and
              posture is the inverted pendulum model. If we focus on
              appropriate versions of the model we can use it to identify the
              gravitational and acceleration perturbations and pinpoint the
              motor mechanisms that can defend against any perturbation. We saw
              that in quiet standing an ankle strategy applies only in the AP
              direction and that a separate hip load/unload strategy by the hip
              abd/adductors is the totally dominant defence in the ML direction
              when standing with feet side by side. In other standing positions
              (tandem, or intermediate) the two mechanisms still work
              separately, but their roles reverse. In the tandem position ML
              balance is an ankle mechanism (invertors/evertors) while in the
              AP direction a hip load/unloading mechanism dominates. During
              initiation and termination of gait these two separate mechanisms
              control the trajectory of the COP to ensure the desired
              acceleration and deceleration of the COM. During initiation the
              initial acceleration of the COM forward towards the stance limb
              is achieved by a posterior and lateral movement of the COP
              towards the swing limb. After this release phase there is a
              sudden loading of the stance limb which shifts the COP to the
              stance limb. The COM is now accelerated forward and laterally
              towards the future position of the swinging foot. Also ML shifts
              of the COP were controlled by the hip abductors/adductors and all
              AP shifts were under the control of the ankle
              plantar/dorsiflexors. During termination the trajectory of both
              COM and COP reverse. As the final weight-bearing on the stance
              foot takes place the COM is passing forward along the medial
              border of that foot. Hyperactivity of that foot's plantarflexors
              takes the COP forward and when the final foot begins to bear
              weight the COP moves rapidly across and suddenly stops at a
              position ahead of the future position of the COM. Then the
              plantarflexors of both feet release and allow the COP to move
              posteriorly and approach the COM and meet it as quiet stance is
              achieved. The inverted pendulum model permitted us to understand
              the separate roles of the two mechanisms during these critical
              unbalancing and rebalancing periods. During walking the inverted
              pendulum model explained the dynamics of the balance of HAT in
              both the AP and ML directions. Here the model includes the couple
              due to the acceleration of the weight-bearing hip as well as
              gravitational perturbations. The exclusive control of AP balance
              and posture are the hip extensors and flexors, while in the ML
              direction the dominant control is with the hip abductors with
              very minor adductor involvement. At the ankle the inverted
              pendulum model sees the COM passing forward along the medial
              border to the weight-bearing foot. The model predicts that during
              single support the body is falling forward and being accelerated

              predicts an insignificant role of the ankle invertors/evertors in
              the ML control. Rather, the future position of the swing foot is
              the critical variable or more specifically the lateral
              displacement from the COM at the start of single support. The
              position is actually under the control of the hip abd/adductors
              during the previous early swing phase. The critical importance of
              the hip abductors/adductors in balance during all phases of
              standing and walking is now evident. This separate mechanism is
              important from a neural control perspective and clinically it
              focuses major attention on therapy and potential problems with
              some surgical procedures. On the other hand the minuscule role of
              the ankle invertors/evertors is important to note. Except for the
              tandem standing position these muscles have negligible
              involvement in balance control.",

              center of pressure (COP) changes in the anterior-posterior (A/P)
              and medial-lateral (M/L) directions from a single force platform.
              Recording from a single force platform, researchers are unable to
              recognize two separate mechanisms that become evident when two
              force platforms are used. Depending on the stance position taken,
              many combinations of an ankle mechanism and a hip (load/unload)
              mechanism are evident. In side-by-side stance, A/P balance is
              totally under ankle (plantar/dorsiflexor) control, whereas M/L
              balance is under hip (abductor/adductor) control. In tandem
              stance, the A/P balance is dominated by the hip mechanism, with
              mixed and small or sometimes negligible contributions by the
              ankle plantar/dorsiflexors: for M/L balance, the reverse is
              evident; ankle invertors/evertors dominate, with mixed and small
              contribution from the hip load/unload mechanism. In an
              intermediate 45 degrees stance position, both ankle and hip
              mechanisms contribute to the net balance control in totally
              different ways. In the M/L direction the two strategies
              reinforce, whereas in the A/P direction the ankle mechanism must
              overcome and cancel most of the inappropriate contribution by the
              hip load/unload mechanism. A spatial plot of the separate
              mechanisms reveals the fact that the random-looking COP scatter
              plot is nothing more than a spatial and temporal summation of two
              separate spatial plots. A straight line joining the individual
              COPs under each foot is the load/unload line controlled by the
              hip mechanism. At right angles to this load/unload line in the
              side-by-side and tandem positions is the independent control line
              by the ankle muscles. In an intermediate standing position, the
              separate control lines exist, but now the ankle control is not
              orthogonal to the load/unload line; rather, it acts at an angle
              of approximately 60 degrees. The direction of these ankle control
              and load/unload lines also allows us to pinpoint the muscle
              groups responsible at the ankle and hip in any of the stance
              positions.",

  abstract = "Interactions between proprioceptive and vestibular inputs
              contributing to the generation of balance corrections may vary
              across muscles depending on the availability of sensory
              information at centres initiating and modulating muscle
              synergies, and the efficacy with which the muscle action can
              prevent a fall. Information which is not available from one
              sensory system may be obtained by switching to another.
              Alternatively, interactions between sensory systems and the
              muscle to which this interaction is targeted may be fixed during
              neural development and not switchable. To investigate these
              different concepts, balance corrections with three different sets
              of proprioceptive trigger signals were examined under eyes-open
              and eyes-closed conditions in the muscles of normal subjects and
              compared with those of subjects with bilateral peripheral
              vestibular loss. The different sets of early proprioceptive
              inputs were obtained by employing three combinations of support
              surface rotation and translation, for which ankle inputs were
              nulled, normal or enhanced, the knees were either locked or in
              flexion, and the trunk was either in flexion or extension. Three
              types of proprioceptive and vestibulospinal interactions were
              identified in muscles responses. These interactions were typified
              by the responses of triceps surae, quadriceps, and paraspinal
              muscles. The amplitudes of stretch responses at 50 ms after the
              onset of ankle flexion in triceps surae muscles were related to
              the velocity of ankle stretch. The amplitude of
              balance-correcting responses at 100 ms corresponded more with
              stretch of the biarticular gastrocnemius when the knee was
              re-extended at 60 ms. Absent stretch reflexes at 50 ms in triceps
              surae with nulled ankle inputs caused a minor, 12-ms delay in the
              onset of balance-correcting responses in triceps surae muscles.
              Vestibular loss caused no change in the amplitude of
              balance-correcting responses, but a negligible decrease in onset
              latency in triceps surae even with nulled ankle inputs. Stretch
              responses in quadriceps at 80 ms increased with the velocity of
              knee flexion but were overall lower in amplitude in vestibular
              loss subjects. Balance-correcting responses in quadriceps had
              amplitudes which were related to the directions of initial trunk
              movements, were still present when knee inputs were negligible
              and were also altered after vestibular loss. Stretch and
              unloading responses in paraspinals at 80 ms were consistent with
              the direction of initial trunk flexion and extension. Subsequent
              balance-correcting responses in paraspinals were delayed 20 ms in
              onset and altered in amplitude by vestibular loss. The changes in
              the amplitudes of ankle (tibialis anterior), knee (quadriceps)
              and trunk (paraspinal) muscle responses with vestibular loss
              affected the amplitudes and timing of trunk angular velocities,
              requiring increased stabilizing tibialis anterior, paraspinal and
              trapezius responses post 240 ms as these subjects attempted to
              remain upright. The results suggest that trunk inputs provide an
              ideal candidate for triggering balance corrections as these would
              still be present when vestibular, ankle and knee inputs are
              absent. The disparity between the amplitudes of stretch reflex
              and automatic balance-correcting responses in triceps surae and
              the insignificant alteration in the timing of balance-correcting
              responses in these muscles with nulled ankle inputs indicates
              that ankle inputs do not trigger balance corrections.
              Furthermore, modulation of balance corrections normally performed
              by vestibular inputs in some but not all muscles is not achieved
              by switching to another sensory system on vestibular loss. We
              postulate that a confluence of trunk and upper-leg proprioceptive
              input establishes the basic timing of automatic, triggered
              balance corrections which is then preferentially weighted by
              vestibular modulation in muscles that prevent falling. The
              organisation of balance corrections around trunk inputs portrayed
              here would have considerable advantage for the infant learning
              balance control, but forces balance control centres to rely on
              limited sensory information related to this most unstable body
              segment, the trunk, when triggering balance corrections.",

              zones were identified: high preference, low preference,
              undesirable and unstable zones. The high preference zone is
              defined as the area where the CoP is found 99\% of the time
              during quiet standing. The area where the CoP is found during the
              remaining 1\% of the time is called the low preference zone. The
              undesirable zone is defined as the CoP area where the subject is
              forced to change posture in order to maintain balance, and the
              unstable zone is defined as the CoP area in which the subject is

              stability. A general model of the proposed four stability zones

              (KIS)--which all but requires a laboratory setting--and (ii)
              Chattecx Balance System (CBS)--which is particularly suited for
              measurement of sway in the dynamic environment of sports.
              Measurement of sway was performed in 29 subjects twice at
              baseline and twice at follow-up 2-4 weeks later. One measurement
              consisted of four 25-second sequences (eyes open, parallel feet;
              eyes closed, parallel feet; eyes open, tandem Romberg; eyes
              closed, tandem Romberg). Factor analysis revealed influence of
              sight and stance on sway, marked interaction between these two
              factors and a decrease in sway on retest on the same day.
              Coefficients of variation were--KIS: 0.13-0.23; CBS: 0.11-0.25.
              Body height was a covariate for all parameters. Kistler 9861A
              force platform and CBS were correlated (baseline: r(s) = 0.47;
              follow-up: r(s) = 0.9). These findings suggest that, when the
              effects of acclimatization and covariance of body height were
              taken into account, CBS was as reliable and reproducible as KIS
              in our laboratory.",

  abstract = "The problem of how the nervous system fuses sensory information
              from multiple modalities for upright stance control remains
              largely unsolved. It is well established that the visual,
              vestibular, and somatosensory modalities provide position and
              rate (e.g., velocity, acceleration) information for estimation of
              body dynamics. However, it is unknown whether any particular
              property dominates when multisensory information is fused. Our
              recent stochastic analysis of postural sway during quiet stance
              suggested that sensory input provides more accurate information
              about the body's velocity than its position or acceleration. Here
              we tested this prediction by degrading major sources of velocity
              information through removal/attenuation of sensory information
              from vision and proprioception. Experimental measures of postural
              sway were compared with model predictions to determine whether
              sway behavior was indicative of a deficit in velocity information
              rather than position or acceleration information. Subjects stood
              with eyes closed on a support surface that was 1) fixed, 2) foam,
              or 3) sway-referenced. Six measures characterizing the stochastic
              structure of postural sway behaved in a manner consistent with
              model predictions of degraded velocity information. Results were
              inconsistent with the effect of degrading only position or
              acceleration information. These findings support the hypothesis
              that velocity information is the most accurate form of sensory
              information used to stabilize posture during quiet stance. Our
              results are consistent with the assumption that changes in sway
              behavior resulting from commonly used experimental manipulations
              (e.g., foam, sway-referencing, eyes closed) are primarily
              attributed to loss of accurate velocity information.",

              investigations which perturb upright stance with support surface

              behaves like a two-segment pendulum, displaying both in-phase and

              has simultaneously co-existing in-phase and anti-phase patterns.
              Subjects stood with eyes closed in three sensory conditions: a
              fixed surface, a foam surface, and a sway-referenced surface.
              Spectral analysis showed that the body behaved like a multi-link
              pendulum with two co-existing modes. The angles of the trunk and
              leg segments were in-phase for frequencies below 1Hz and
              anti-phase for frequencies above 1Hz. The shift from in-phase to
              anti-phase sway showed an abrupt change for the fixed and foam

  author   = "Loram, Ian D and Maganaris, Constantinos N and Lakie, Martin",
  abstract = "It has been widely assumed for nearly a century, that postural
              muscles operate in a spring-like manner and that muscle length
              signals joint angle (the mechano-reflex mechanism). Here we
              employ automated analysis of ultrasound images to resolve calf
              muscle (soleus and gastrocnemius) length changes as small as 10
              mum in standing subjects. Previously, we have used balancing of a
              real inverted pendulum to make predictions about human standing.
              Here we test and confirm these predictions on 10 subjects
              standing quietly. We show that on average the calf muscles are
              actively adjusted 2.6 times per second and 2.8 times per
              unidirectional sway of the body centre of mass (CoM). These
              alternating, small (30-300 microm) movements provide impulsive,
              ballistic regulation of CoM movement. The timing and pattern of
              these adjustments are consistent with multisensory integration of
              all information regarding motion of the CoM, pattern recognition,
              prediction and planning using internal models and are not
              consistent with control solely by local reflexes. Because the
              system is unstable, errors in stabilization provide a
              perturbation which grows into a sway which has to be reacted to
              and corrected. Sagittal sway results from this impulsive control
              of calf muscle activity rather than internal sources (e.g. the
              heart, breathing). This process is quite unlike the
              mechano-reflex paradigm. We suggest that standing is a skilled,
              trial and error activity that improves with experience and is
              automated (possibly by the cerebellum). These results complement
              and extend our recent demonstration that paradoxical muscle
              movements are the norm in human standing.",

              of studies of human balance during quiet standing and perturbed
              standing. Centre of mass (CoM), centre of pressure (CoP) and
              electromyogram (EMG) or similar measures are commonly recorded to
              quantify human balance control. In this paper we show that to
              identify the rigid body dynamics and the physiological mechanism
              that controls the body separately, one has to externally perturb
              the body with known perturbations and to use the indirect (IA) or
              joint input--output approach (JA) for identification. However, in
              many balance control studies the direct approach (DA) have been
              used, which is well suited to study open-loop systems but will
              give erroneous results when applied to a closed-loop system, as
              in human balance control. The cross-correlation function and
              linear regression are examples of the erroneous application of
              the DA approach in human balance control studies. The
              consequences of this erroneous DA are given. In addition a new
              application of the JA is presented that identifies physiological
              mechanisms that control balance, including passive and active
              feedback pathways. This new method is compared with existing
              identification schemes that use the IA and an existing JA that
              estimates the active pathway. Also it is shown how descriptive
              measures such as the power spectral densities (PSD) or the
              stabilogram diffusion plot (SDP) of the CoP and/or CoM depends on
              the PSD of internal perturbations and sensor noise, which are not
              measured. Although descriptive measures can be used to describe
              the state of the balance control system for a particular
              situation, it does not separate the dynamics of unknown processes
              that perturb balance from the dynamics of the active and passive
              feedback mechanisms that controls balance. Only the IA and the
              preferred JA can give estimates of the passive and active passive
              feedback mechanisms that control balance.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the postural adaptations to inclined
              walking in spinal cord injured (SCI) subjects. METHODS: Eight
              subjects with an incomplete spinal cord injury and eight age- and
              sex-matched healthy control subjects walked on a treadmill at
              five different grades (from -10 to 10\%) without any assistance.
              The movements of the trunk and pelvis were recorded with four
              high-resolution cameras. RESULTS: The SCI subjects walked with
              greater forward tilt of both trunk and pelvic segments during
              level or inclined walking and could not adapt their body
              orientation to the inclination of the support surface as observed
              in healthy control subjects. Trunk and pelvic rotations as well
              as lateral excursions were maintained constant during inclined
              walking in both groups of subjects but total excursions were
              always greater in the SCI subjects. CONCLUSIONS: We argue that
              the forward bending posture observed in SCI subjects at any
              treadmill grade is adopted to compensate for a certain degree of
              instability due to lower-limb deficits and is a postural
              adaptation to the daily use of ambulatory assistive devices.
              SIGNIFICANCE: The bent posture adopted by SCI subjects is not
              adequate when performing level or downhill walking and can lead
              to a loss of balance or a fall in these subjects.",

              contribution of each ankle to balance maintenance. Eight chronic
              hemiparetic patients were included. Balance responses were
              elicited by continuous random platform movements. We measured
              body sway and ground reaction forces below each foot to calculate
              corrective ankle torques in each leg. These measurements yielded
              the Frequency Response Function (FRF) of the stabilizing
              mechanisms, which expresses the amount and timing of the
              generated corrective torque in response to sway at the specified
              frequencies. The FRFs were used to calculate the relative
              contribution of the paretic and non-paretic ankle to the total
              amount of generated corrective torque to correct sway. All
              patients showed a clear asymmetry in the balance contribution in
              favor of the non-paretic ankle. Paretic balance contribution was
              significantly smaller than the contribution of the paretic leg to
              weight bearing, and did not show a clear relation with the
              contribution to weight bearing. In contrast, a group of healthy
              subjects instructed to distribute their weight asymmetrically
              showed a one-on-one relation between the contribution to weight
              bearing and to balance. We conclude that the presented approach
              objectively quantifies the contribution of each ankle to balance
              maintenance. Application of this method in longitudinal surveys
              of balance rehabilitation makes it possible to disentangle the
              different recovery mechanisms. Such insights will be critical for
              the development and evaluation of rehabilitation strategies.",

              pseudorandom external periodic perturbations can be explained by
              continuous time invariant feedback control. Nine healthy subjects
              participated in this study. Center of mass and ankle torque
              responses were elicited by periodic platform perturbations in
              forward-backward directions containing energy in the 0.06- to
              4.5-Hz frequency band. Subjects had their eyes open (EO) or eyes

              and a remnant (stochastic) component using spectral analysis. It
              is concluded that periodic responses can explain most of the

              The ratio of the body sway and ankle torque remnant PSD reflects
              the body dynamics. Both findings are consistent with the idea
              that estimation of body orientation is part of a continuous

              in this study. The upright standing posture was evaluated by
              means of two piezo-resistive electrogoniometers and a force

              acute lateral ankle sprain? (3) Is postural control adversely
              affected in those with chronic ankle instability? DATA SOURCES:
              PubMed and CINAHL entries from 1966 through October 2006 were

              balance, chronic ankle instability, functional ankle instability,
              postural control, and postural sway. STUDY SELECTION: Only
              studies assessing postural control measures in participants on a
              stable force plate performing the modified Romberg test were
              included. To be included, a study had to address at least 1 of

              results for calculation of effect sizes or odds ratios where
              applicable. DATA EXTRACTION: We calculated odds ratios with 95\%
              confidence intervals for studies assessing postural control as a
              risk factor for lateral ankle sprains. Effect sizes were
              estimated with the Cohen d and associated 95\% confidence

              healthy and injured groups, or healthy and injured limbs,
              respectively. DATA SYNTHESIS: Poor postural control is most
              likely associated with an increased risk of sustaining an acute
              ankle sprain. Postural control is impaired after acute lateral
              ankle sprain, with deficits identified in both the injured and
              uninjured sides compared with controls. Although chronic ankle
              instability has been purported to be associated with altered
              postural control, these impairments have not been detected
              consistently with the use of traditional instrumented measures.
              CONCLUSIONS: Instrumented postural control testing on stable
              force plates is better at identifying deficits that are
              associated with an increased risk of ankle sprain and that occur
              after acute ankle sprains than at detecting deficits related to

              (Cue-Only(Control) and Cue-Only(Conditioning) trials) in the
              absence of balance perturbations. Cue-Only(Conditioning) trials
              were used to determine whether postural perturbations were
              required in order to trigger PRs. Counter-balancing the order of
              Control and Conditioning blocks allowed Cue-Only(Control) trials
              to examine both the audio-spinal/acoustic startle effects of the
              auditory cue and the carryover effects of the initial
              conditioning procedure. In Experiment 2, six participants first
              experienced five consecutive Tone-Only trials that were followed
              by twenty-five conditioning trials. After conditioning, five
              Tone-Only trials were again presented consecutively to first
              elicit and then extinguish the conditioned PRs. Surface
              electromyography (EMG) recorded muscle activity in soleus (SOL),
              tibialis anterior (TA) and rectus femoris (RF). EMG onset
              latencies and amplitudes were calculated together with the onset
              latency, peak and time-to-peak of shank angular accelerations.
              Results indicated that an auditory cue could be conditioned to
              initiate PRs in multiple muscles without balance-relevant sensory
              triggers generated by balance perturbations. Postural synergies
              involving excitation of TA and RF and inhibition of SOL were
              observed following the Cue-Only(Conditioning) trials that
              resulted in shank angular accelerations in the direction required
              to counter the expected toes-up tilt. Postural synergies were
              triggered in response to the auditory cue even 15 min
              post-conditioning. Furthermore, conditioned PRs were quickly
              extinguished as participants became unresponsive by the third
              trial in extinction. In conclusion, our results reveal that the
              CNS does not require sensory feedback from postural perturbations
              in order to trigger PRs.",

              Explicit solutions to the Hamilton--Jacobi equation for optimal
              control of rigid-body motion are obtained by solving an algebraic
              matrix equation. The stability is investigated with Lyapunov
              function theory and it is shown that global asymptotic stability
              holds. It is also shown how optimal control and adaptive control
              may act in concert in the case of unknown or uncertain system
              parameters. The solution describes motion strategies of minimum
              effort and variance. The proposed optimal control is formulated
              to be suitable as a posture and movement model for experimental
              validation and verification. The combination of adaptive and

  abstract = "Human bipedal stance is often modeled as a single inverted
              pendulum that pivots at the ankle joints in the sagittal plane.
              Because the center of body mass is usually maintained in front of
              the ankle joints, ankle extensor torque is continuously required
              to prevent the body from falling. During quiet standing, both
              passive and active mechanisms contribute to generate the ankle
              extensor torque counteracting gravity. This study aimed to
              investigate the active stabilization mechanism in more detail.
              Eight healthy subjects were requested to stand quietly on three
              different surfaces of 1) toes-up, 2) level, and 3) toes-down.
              Surface electromyogram (EMG) was recorded from the medial head of
              the gastrocnemius (MG), soleus (SOL), and tibialis anterior
              muscles. Inclination angle of the body was simultaneously
              measured. As a result, we found that EMG activities of MG and SOL
              were lowest during the toes-up standing and highest during the
              toes-down, indicating that increased (decreased) passive
              contribution required less (more) extensor torque generated by
              active muscle contraction. Frequency domain analysis also
              revealed that sway-related modulation of the ankle extensor
              activity (0.12-4.03 Hz) was unchanged among the three foot
              inclinations. On the other hand, isometric contraction strength
              of these muscles increased as the slope declined (toes-up < level
              < toes-down). These results support the idea that by regulating
              the isometric contraction strength, the CNS maintains a constant
              level of muscle tone and resultant ankle stiffness irrespective
              of the passive contribution. Such control scheme would be crucial
              when we consider the low bandwidth of the intermittent
              controller.",

  abstract = "Humans and other species are unable to stand perfectly still;
              their bodies continuously sway during stance even during
              concentrated efforts to avoid such movement. Traditionally, this
              phenomenon has been viewed as an inability of the central nervous
              system (CNS) to maintain perfect equilibrium because of its
              reliance on feedback from sensory signals to control corrective
              ground-reaction forces. Using a novel method to minimize
              movements of the body during stance without subject awareness, we
              have made the unique discovery that ground-reaction forces are
              generated independent of body sway, as evidenced by observations
              of increased centre of pressure variability when postural sway is
              minimized experimentally. Contrary to traditional views, our
              results suggest that postural sway may be used by the CNS as an
              exploratory mechanism to ensure that continuous dynamic inputs
              are provided by multiple sensory systems. This novel paradigm has
              the potential to significantly shift long-standing views on
              balance, and questions the theoretical basis behind conventional

              Reaction time and center of pressure (COP) movement during the

              response to translations with either a SHORT (100ms) or LONG (2s)
              acceleration-deceleration interval presented in either a
              predictable or random order. RESULTS: Age-related differences in
              kinematic postural responses were greater during LONG compared to
              SHORT translations. However, both LONG and SHORT translations
              elicited a similar change in EMG latencies and amplitudes between
              the older and young adults. No age effects on the presentation
              order (predictable or random) of the translations were observed.
              CONCLUSIONS: LONG compared to SHORT surface translations magnify
              the age-related kinematic but not the EMG changes in reactive
              postural control. The anticipatory component of postural control
              was not affected by age. SIGNIFICANCE: Translations with longer
              acceleration-deceleration intervals reveal more age-related
              differences in postural control, which are otherwise masked by
              the deceleration effects inherent to shorter translations.",

              abnormalities in balance responses in Parkinson's disease (PD)
              patients compared to controls at the group level, but its
              clinical value in the diagnostic process and fall risk estimation
              in individual patients leaves for improvement. Therefore, we
              investigated whether a new approach, focusing on the balance
              responses to the very first and fully unpractised trial rather
              than a pooled mean response to a series of balance perturbations,
              could further improve the diagnostic utility of dynamic
              posturography. Following the first trial, subjects were exposed
              to repeated balance perturbations, which also permitted us to
              investigate the training responses. Fourteen patients with PD and
              18 age-matched controls were enrolled, who received a series of
              multidirectional postural perturbations, induced by support
              surface rotations. We measured trunk and upper arm kinematics and
              electromyographic responses, and evaluated group differences at
              three levels: the postural response to the very first backward
              perturbation; pooled first and habituated postural responses; and
              habituation rates. Analysis of the first trial responses yielded
              similar results as evaluation of the mean response over trials:
              forward flexion of the trunk induced by backward perturbations
              was decreased in patients, accompanied by increased muscle
              responses present. Moreover, trunk movement and muscle activity
              were equally present in both groups-suggesting a preserved
              training response in PD patients. Early masseter activity in both
              groups might be indicative of a startle-like component to the
              balance response. In terms of diagnostic utility, focusing on the
              first trial response or habituation rate is no better than
              analysis of pooled responses to a series of perturbations. The
              apparently preserved training response in PD patients suggests
              that balance reactions in PD can be improved by repeated
              exposure, and this may have implications for future exercise
              studies. Early masseter activity warrants further studies to
              evaluate a potential startle component in the pathophysiology of
              balance disorders.",

              vestibular dysfunction. We evaluated the effects of an
              incrementally increasing surface tilt perturbation intervention
              for individuals with chronic vestibular pathology on gait,
              activities of daily living, and dizziness. METHODS: Participants
              (n = 29) were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups. The first group
              received random surface tilt perturbations of increasing angles
              and speed, half of the trials with vision-occluding goggles, 3
              times weekly for 3 weeks (P group). The second group received
              tilt perturbation intervention (as above) plus a home program of
              vestibular rehabilitation exercises (P+EX group). The third group
              performed only the vestibular rehabilitation exercises (EX
              group). Outcome measures included temporospatial gait measures,
              Dynamic Gait Index (DGI), Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI),
              Patient Specific Functional Scale (PSFS), and a Perceived
              Outcomes Scale (POS). RESULTS: The P and P+EX groups showed
              greater improvement on the PSFS and the POS compared to the EX
              group. DGI scores indicated decreased fall risk in 8 of 9
              individuals who participated in P or P+EX training and who
              initially scored below the 19-point cutoff score. Both the P and
              P+EX groups showed significant within-group changes on some gait
              characteristics, DGI, DHI, PSFS, and POS measures. The EX group
              showed within-group change only on the DHI. DISCUSSION AND
              CONCLUSION: Surface tilt perturbation training appears to be more
              effective for improving abilities at the activities and
              participation levels than vestibular exercises alone. In
              addition, tilt perturbation training reduced fall risk as
              measured by the DGI.",

  author   = "Yiou, E and Ditcharles, S and Le Bozec, S",
  abstract = "During voluntary step initiation (SI), propulsive forces are
              generated during anticipatory postural adjustments (APA) which
              displace the centre-of-gravity (CoG) in the desired direction.
              These propulsive forces are implemented by ankle synergy,
              bilateral soleus inhibition followed by activation of tibialis
              anterior (TA). The aim of this study was to investigate the
              effect of fatigue applied to ankle dorsiflexors on APA associated
              with SI and on related motor performance. Eight young healthy
              participants initiated stepping before and after a protocol
              designed to generate fatigue in ankle dorsiflexors. Fatigue was
              induced by series of high-level isometric contractions performed
              until exhaustion. Results showed that, with fatigue, the level of
              TA activation during APA, anticipatory postural dynamics
              (backward centre-of-pressure displacement and forward CoG
              velocity) and related motor performance (peak of CoG velocity)
              were attenuated, while APA duration and total SI duration

              timed standing balance and functional reach tests provide
              important information, however, they cannot accurately quantify
              specific postural control mechanisms. The Microsoft Kinect™

              and simple to setup it may bridge this gap. This study assessed
              the concurrent validity of the Microsoft Kinect™ against a
              benchmark reference, a multiple-camera 3D motion analysis system,
              in 20 healthy subjects during three postural control tests: (i)
              forward reach, (ii) lateral reach, and (iii) single-leg
              eyes-closed standing balance. For the reach tests, the outcome
              measures consisted of distance reached and trunk flexion angle in
              the sagittal (forward reach) and coronal (lateral reach) planes.
              For the standing balance test the range and deviation of movement
              in the anatomical landmark positions for the sternum, pelvis,
              knee and ankle and the lateral and anterior trunk flexion angle
              were assessed. The Microsoft Kinect™ and 3D motion analysis
              systems had comparable inter-trial reliability (ICC
              difference=0.06$\pm$0.05; range, 0.00-0.16) and excellent
              concurrent validity, with Pearson's r-values >0.90 for the
              majority of measurements (r=0.96$\pm$0.04; range, 0.84-0.99).
              However, ordinary least products analyses demonstrated
              proportional biases for some outcome measures associated with the
              pelvis and sternum. These findings suggest that the Microsoft
              Kinect™ can validly assess kinematic strategies of postural
              control. Given the potential benefits it could therefore become a
              useful tool for assessing postural control in the clinical

  abstract = "PURPOSE/BACKGROUND: Cryotherapy is commonly used in physical
              therapy with many known benefits; however several investigations
              have reported decreased functional performance following
              therapeutic application thereof. The purpose of this study was to
              determine the effect of cryotherapy applied to the ankle on
              static and dynamic standing balance. It was hypothesized that
              balance would be decreased after cryotherapy application.
              METHODS: Twenty individuals (aged 18 to 40 years) participated in
              this research project. Each participant was tested under two
              conditions: an experimental condition where subjects received ice
              water immersion of the foot and ankle for 15 minutes immediately
              before balance testing and a control condition completed at room
              temperature. A Biodex\textregistered{} Balance System was used to
              quantify balance using anterior/posterior (AP), medial/lateral
              (ML), and overall balance indices. Paired t-tests were used to
              compare the balance indices for the two conditions with alpha set
              at 0.05 a priori. Effect size was also calculated to account for
              the multiple comparisons made. RESULTS: The static balance
              indices did not display statistically significant differences
              between the post-cryotherapy and the control conditions with low
              effect sizes. Dynamic ML indices significantly increased
              following the cryotherapy application compared to the control
              exhibiting a moderate effect size indicating decreased balance
              following cryotherapy application. No differences were noted
              between experimental and control conditions for the dynamic AP or
              overall balance indices while a small effect size was noted for
              both. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that cryotherapy to the
              ankle has a negative effect on the ML component of dynamic
              balance following ice water immersion. CLINICAL RELEVANCE:
              Immediate return to play following cryotherapy application is
              cautioned given the decreased dynamic ML balance and potential
              for increased injury risk. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3b Case-control

  abstract = "ABSTRACT The increased awareness of the importance of gait and
              postural control to quality of life and functional independence
              has led many research groups to study the pathophysiology,
              epidemiology, clinical, and therapeutic aspects of these motor
              functions. In recognition of the increased awareness of the
              significance of this topic, the Movement Disorders journal is
              devoting this entire issue to gait and postural control. Leading
              research groups provide critical reviews of the current knowledge
              and propose future directions for this evolving field. The
              intensive work in this area throughout the world has created an
              urgent need for a unified language. Because gait and postural
              disturbances are so common, the clinical classification should be
              clear, straightforward, and simple to use. As an introduction to
              this special issue, we propose a new clinically based
              classification scheme that is organized according to the dominant
              observed disturbance, while taking into account the results of a
              basic neurological exam. The proposed classification
              differentiates between continuous and episodic gait disturbances
              because this subdivision has important ramifications from the
              functional, prognostic, and mechanistic perspectives. We
              anticipate that research into gait and postural control will
              continue to flourish over the next decade as the search for new
              ways of promoting mobility and independence aims to keep up with
              the exponentially growing population of aging older adults.
              Hopefully, this new classification scheme and the articles
              focusing on gait and postural control in this special issue of
              the Movement Disorders journal will help to facilitate future
              investigations in this exciting, rapidly growing area. ? 2013

              are considered to negatively impact balance control, but the
              existence of a direct association is still an issue of debate.
              This is possibly due to the fact that balance assessment is
              complex, reflects different underlying physiologic mechanisms and
              involves quantitative measurements of postural sway or timing of
              performance during balance tasks. The present study evaluated the
              moderator effect of static postural control on the association of
              power and strength with dynamic balance tasks. METHODS:
              Fifty-seven healthy 65-75 year old individuals performed tests of
              dynamic functional balance (walking speed under different
              conditions) and of strength, power and static postural control.
              RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic balance performance (walking
              speed) was associated with lower limb strength and power, as well
              as postural control under conditions requiring postural
              adjustments (narrow surface walking r(2) = 0.31, p < 0.001). An
              interaction effect between strength and static postural control
              was found with narrow surface walking and talking while walking
              (change of $\beta$ 0.980, p < 0.001 in strength for 1 SD
              improvements in static postural control for narrow walking, and
              [Formula: see text] -0.730, p < 0.01 in talking while walking).
              These results indicate that good static postural control
              facilitates the utilisation of lower limb strength to better
              perform complex, dynamic functional balance tasks. Practical

  abstract = "PURPOSE/BACKGROUND: A number of different balance assessment
              techniques are currently available and widely used. These include
              both subjective and objective assessments. The ability to provide
              quantitative measures of balance and posture is the benefit of
              objective tools, however these instruments are not generally
              utilized outside of research laboratory settings due to cost,
              complexity of operation, size, duration of assessment, and
              general practicality. The purpose of this pilot study was to
              assess the value and validity of using software developed to
              access the iPod and iPhone accelerometers output and translate
              that to the measurement of human balance. METHODS: Thirty healthy
              college-aged individuals (13 male, 17 female; age = 26.1 $\pm$
              8.5 years) volunteered. Participants performed a static Athlete's
              Single Leg Test protocol for 10 sec, on a Biodex Balance System
              SD while concurrently utilizing a mobile device with balance
              software. Anterior/posterior stability was recorded using both
              devices, described as the displacement in degrees from level, and
              was termed the ``balance score.'' RESULTS: There were no
              significant differences between the two reported balance scores
              (p = 0.818. Mean balance score on the balance platform was 1.41
              $\pm$ 0.90, as compared to 1.38 $\pm$ 0.72 using the mobile
              device. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for a valid, convenient, and
              cost-effective tool to objectively measure balance. Results of
              this study are promising, as balance score derived from the
              Smartphone accelerometers were consistent with balance scores
              obtained from a previously validated balance system. However,
              further investigation is necessary as this version of the mobile
              software only assessed balance in the anterior/posterior
              direction. Additionally, further testing is necessary on a
              healthy populations and as well as those with impairment of the
              motor control system. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 2b (Observational

              and a noninjured control group during performance of the SEBT.
              DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: University biomechanics
              laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: A total of 81
              participants with acute first-time LAS (53 men, 28 women; age =
              23.22 $\pm$ 4.93 years, height = 1.73 $\pm$ 0.09 m, mass = 75.72

              71.55 $\pm$ 11.31 kg). INTERVENTION: Participants performed the
              anterior (ANT), posterolateral (PL), and posteromedial (PM) reach
              directions of the SEBT. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): We assessed
              3-dimensional kinematics of the lower extremity joints and
              associated fractal dimension (FD) of the COP path during
              performance of the SEBT. RESULTS: The LAS group had decreased
              normalized reach distances in the ANT, PL, and PM directions when
              compared with the control group on their injured (ANT: 58.16\%

              106.62\% $\pm$ 5.78\%) limbs (P < .01). This observation was
              associated with altered temporal sagittal-plane kinematic
              profiles throughout each reach attempt and at the point of
              maximum reach (P < .05). This result was associated with a
              reduced FD of the COP path for each reach direction on the
              injured limb only (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Acute first-time LAS
              was associated with bilateral deficits in postural control, as
              evidenced by the bilateral reduction in angular displacement of
              the lower extremity joints and reduced reach distances and FD of

              perturbations). METHODS: Individuals with stroke completed a
              clinical assessment, including 30 s of quiet standing and
              lean-and-release postural perturbations, at admission to
              in-patient rehabilitation. Quiet standing centre of pressure

              was performed. Net COP amplitude, between-limb synchronization,
              and ratios of individual-limb COP were determined for each
              frequency level of interest, and for the non-decomposed signal

              individuals who exhibited Failed and Successful Responses during
              (a) unconstrained and (b) encouraged-use lean-and-release trials.
              RESULTS: Individuals with Failed Responses during the
              unconstrained lean-and-release trials displayed greater net COP

              within a frequency range of 0.40-3.20Hz. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced

              reflected in impaired reactive control of quiet standing.

              which reactive control of quiet standing is impaired in

              aimed to systematically evaluate the reliability and concurrent
              validity of the WBB for assessment of static standing balance.
              Articles were retrieved from six databases (Medline, SCOPUS,
              EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Inspec) from 2007 to 2017. After
              independent screening by two reviewers, 25 articles were
              included. Two reviewers performed the data extraction and quality
              assessment. Test-retest reliability was investigated in 12
              studies, with intraclass correlation coefficients or Pearson's
              correlation values showing a range from poor to excellent
              reliability (range: 0.27 to 0.99). Concurrent validity (i.e.
              comparison with another force platform) was examined in 21

              examining the association between the same outcome measures
              collected on both devices. For studies reporting predominantly
              poor to moderate validity, potentially influential factors
              included the choice of 1) criterion reference (e.g. not a common
              force platform), 2) test duration (e.g. <30 s for double leg), 3)
              outcome measure (e.g. comparing a centre of pressure variable
              from the WBB with a summary score from the force platform), 4)
              data acquisition platform (studies using Apple iOS reported
              predominantly moderate validity), and 5) low sample size. In

              deprived patients of normal inputs derived from a fixed level

  abstract = "Stepping represents a common means for balance recovery after a
              perturbation to upright posture. Yet little is known regarding
              the biomechanical factors which determine whether a step succeeds
              in preventing a fall. In the present study, we developed a simple
              pendulum-spring model of balance recovery by stepping, and used
              this to assess how step length and step contact time influence
              the effort (leg contact force) and feasibility of balance
              recovery by stepping. We then compared model predictions of step
              characteristics which minimize leg contact force to
              experimentally observed values over a range of perturbation
              strengths. At all perturbation levels, experimentally observed
              step execution times were higher than optimal, and step lengths
              were smaller than optimal. However, the predicted increase in leg
              contact force associated with these deviations was substantial
              only for large perturbations. Furthermore, increases in the
              strength of the perturbation caused subjects to take larger,
              quicker steps, which reduced their predicted leg contact force.
              We interpret these data to reflect young subjects' desire to
              minimize recovery effort, subject to neuromuscular constraints on
              step execution time and step length. Finally, our model predicts
              that successful balance recovery by stepping is governed by a
              coupling between step length, step execution time, and leg
              strength, so that the feasibility of balance recovery decreases
              unless declines in one capacity are offset by enhancements in the
              others. This suggests that one's risk for falls may be affected
              more by small but diffuse neuromuscular impairments than by
              larger impairment in a single motor capacity.",

              postural control by determining the joint moments during balance
              recovery from medio-lateral (M/L) perturbations. Ten adult males
              received medio-lateral (M/L) pushes to the trunk or pelvis. The
              inverted pendulum model of balance control (Winter et al., 1998,
              Journal of Neurophysiology 80, 1211-1221) was validated even
              though the body did not behave as a single pendulum, indicating
              that the centre of pressure (COP) is the variable used to control
              the centre of mass (COM). The perturbation magnitude was random,
              and the central nervous system (CNS) responded with an estimate
              of the largest anticipated perturbation. The observed joint
              moments served to move the COP in the appropriate direction and
              to control the lateral collapse of the trunk. The individual
              joints involved in controlling the COP contributed differing
              amounts to the total recovery response: the hip and spinal
              moments provided the majority of the recovery (approximately
              85\%), while the ankles contributed a small, but significant
              amount (15\%). The differing contributions are based on the
              anatomical constraints and the functional requirements of the
              balance task. The onset of the joint moment was synchronous with
              the joint angle change, and occurred too early (56-116 ms) to be
              result of active muscle contraction. Therefore, the first line of
              defense was provided by muscle stiffness, not reflex-activated
              muscle activity.",

              anterior (TA), soleus (SOL), paraspinals (PARAS), or quadriceps
              muscles. Only SOL muscle activity demonstrated a 38- to 45-ms
              delay for combinations of forward (toe-down) and roll
              perturbations in BVL patients. The amplitude of balance
              correcting responses in leg muscles between 120 and 220 ms was,
              with one exception, severely reduced in BVL patients for eyes
              open and eyes closed conditions. SOL responses were decreased
              bilaterally for toe-up and toe-down perturbations, but more
              significantly reduced in the downhill (load-bearing) leg for
              combined roll and pitch perturbations. TA was significantly
              reduced bilaterally for toe-up perturbations, and in the downhill
              leg for backward roll perturbations. Forward perturbations,
              however, elicited significantly larger TA activity in BVL between
              120 and 220 ms compared to normals, which would act to further
              destabilize the body. As a result of these changes in response
              amplitudes, BVL patients had reduced balance correcting ankle
              torque between 160 and 260 ms and increased torque between 280
              and 380 ms compared to normals. There were no differences in the
              orientation of the resultant ankle torque vectors between BVL and
              normals, both of which were oriented primarily along the pitch
              plane. For combinations of backward (toe-up) and roll
              perturbations BVL patients had larger balance correcting and
              stabilizing reactions (between 350 and 700 ms) in PARAS than
              normals and these corresponded to excessive trunk pitch and roll
              velocities. During roll perturbations, trunk velocities in BVL
              subjects after 200 ms were directed along directions different
              from those of normals. Furthermore, roll instabilities appeared
              later than those of pitch particularly for backward roll
              perturbations. The results of the study show that combinations of
              roll and pitch surface rotations yield important spatiotemporal
              information, especially with respect to trunk response strategies
              changed by BVL which are not revealed by pitch plane
              perturbations alone. Our results indicate that vestibular
              influences are earlier for the pitch plane and are directed to
              leg muscles, whereas roll control is later and focused on trunk
              muscles.",

              pelvis in eight directions: anterio-posterior (AP), medio-lateral
              (ML), and four combinations of these principal directions.
              Perturbations were repeated five times in each direction for six
              conditions (i.e., three different perturbation strengths and
              three different feet orientations). The comparison of the
              averaged ankle sum NJT (AP) responses showed that the time
              courses of the responses elicited by a perturbation acting only
              in the AP direction were identical to those elicited by a
              combination of two corresponding AP and ML perturbations. In
              contrast the observed averaged ankle NJT (ML) responses did not
              follow the same similarity. The comparison of the averaged ankle

              two corresponding AP and ML perturbations. These findings were
              invariable of the experimental conditions and were consistent
              among all the eight subjects. Thereby, we conclude that the ankle
              sum NJT (AP) and the ankle and hip sum NJT (ML) are the global
              variables being controlled. This shows that CNS controls the
              recovery from the multiple direction perturbations of moderate
              strength by decoupling the AP-ML postural space into two
              orthogonal directions (AP and ML).",

              safe posture. The search for these mechanisms needs precise and
              valid 3D measurements including both limbs plus valid
              biomechanical models. The literature shows the need for two force
              platforms to separate the mechanisms at the ankle and hip
              (load/unload mechanism). Also, precise measures ($\approx$0.03

              to record the minute trajectories of all segments and joints. The

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Fall risk depends on ability to maintain balance
              during daily activities, and on ability to recover balance
              following a perturbation such as a slip or trip. We examined
              whether similar neuromuscular variables govern these two domains
              of postural stability. METHODS: We conducted experiments with 25
              older women (mean age=78 yrs, SD=7 yrs). We acquired measures of
              postural steadiness during quiet stance (mean amplitude,
              velocity, and frequency of centre-of-pressure movement when
              standing with eyes open or closed, on a rigid or compliant
              surface). We also measured ability to recover balance using the
              ankle strategy after release from a forward leaning position
              (based on the maximum release angle where recovery was possible,
              and corresponding values of reaction time, rate of ankle torque
              generation, and peak ankle torque). FINDINGS: We found that
              balance recovery variables were not strongly or consistently
              correlated with postural steadiness variables. The maximum
              release angle associated with only three of the sixteen postural
              steadiness variables (mean frequency in rigid, eyes open

              and velocity (r=0.49, P=.015) in compliant, eyes closed
              condition). Reaction time and peak torque did not correlate with
              any steadiness variables, and rate of torque generation
              correlated moderately with the mean amplitude and velocity of the
              centre-of-pressure in the compliant, eyes closed condition
              (r=0.48-0.60). INTERPRETATION: Our results indicate that postural
              steadiness during quiet stance is not predictive of ability to
              recover balance with the ankle strategy. Accordingly, balance
              assessment and fall prevention programs should individually
              target these two components of postural stability.",

              These studies were restricted to postural control in the pitch

              examined the effect of degenerative cerebellar lesions on
              postural control in multiple directions, and studied how such
              lesions affect intersegmental coordination of the legs, trunk and
              arms. We formulated two main questions. (a) Do patients with
              cerebellar ataxia predominantly have balance problems in the
              sagittal or frontal planes? (b) Is instability in cerebellar
              ataxia associated with increased joint motion or with reduced
              joint motion? We selected nine patients with autosomal dominant
              spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)--three with pure ataxia and six with
              mild extra-cerebellar features--and 12 matched controls. Upright
              standing subjects received support surface rotations (7.5 degrees
              at 60 degrees /s) that were randomly delivered in eight different
              directions of pitch or roll. We used full body kinematics to
              determine displacements of the center of mass (COM) and of
              individual body segments. We also collected surface EMG from 10
              leg, trunk and arm muscles. Primary variables of interest were
              COM displacement and trunk control (angles and muscle responses).
              Secondary analyses focused on angles and muscle responses of the
              legs and arms. COM analysis demonstrated that SCA patients had
              greatest instability following backward and laterally directed
              perturbations. Major factors in causing this instability were,
              first, a marked reduction of stimulus-induced knee flexion and,
              second, excessive ``hypermetric'' motion of the pelvis (in roll)
              and trunk (in pitch). Muscle responses of SCA patients were
              characterized by increased late balance correcting activity.
              Responses of patients with pure ataxia were comparable to those
              of patients with mild extra-cerebellar features. A main
              underlying cause of postural instability in SCA patients appears
              to be ``locking'' of the knees, which may reflect compensation
              (by reducing interaction between body links) or reduced
              vestibulocerebellar control over leg muscles. The observed
              pathophysiology is very different from that seen in other patient
              populations.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Low back pain is associated with abnormal movement
              strategies due to changes in neuromuscular control. A plausible
              contributing factor to low back pain is poor control of trunk
              muscles, thus understanding motor control alterations in this
              population can guide rehabilitation. Quantification of postural
              responses following support surface translations is one way to
              examine motor control impairments in people with low back pain.
              METHODS: Twenty-four healthy subjects [mean 33 (SD 11) years] who
              had no low back pain and 26 subjects [mean 39 (SD 13) years] with
              chronic, recurrent low back pain were instructed to stand with
              feet placed on separate force plates, which were mounted on a
              moveable platform. The platform was translated unexpectedly in
              one of 12 directions for a total of 72 trials. For both the
              sagittal and frontal planes, the net center of pressure
              displacement was derived and the total body center of mass was
              calculated by combining kinematic and anthropometric data.
              FINDINGS: For sagittal plane responses, subjects with low back
              pain had reduced and delayed sagittal plane center of pressure
              responses (P<0.01) compared to the subjects without low back

              falls with knees flexed, (b) backward falls with knees extended
              and (c) forward falls with knees flexed. We also examined the
              effect of fall configuration on fall durations, elbow flexion,
              trunk flexion and forearm angles at impact. Forward falls
              resulted in smaller impact velocities of the distal radius,
              longer fall duration, longer braking duration, greater elbow
              flexion and more horizontal landing position of the forearm
              compared to backward falls. The distal radius impact velocity
              during forward falls (1.33 m/s) was significantly lower than in

  abstract = "A common assessment of postural control often involves subjects
              standing on a compliant surface, such as a foam block, to make
              balance tests more challenging. However, the physical properties
              of the foam block used by different researchers can vary
              considerably. The objective of this study was to provide an
              initial approach for investigating whether two of the foam
              properties, i.e. density and elastic modulus, influenced recorded
              anteroposterior and lateral torque variance with eyes open and
              eyes closed. Thirty healthy adults (mean age 22.5 years) were
              assessed with posturography using three different types of foam
              block placed on a force platform. These blocks were categorised:
              firm foam, medium foam and soft foam by their elastic modulus. To
              investigate the spectral characteristics of recorded body
              movements, variance values were calculated for total movements,
              movements 0.1Hz. Results showed that anteroposterior and lateral
              torque variances >0.1Hz were larger when standing on the firm
              foam compared with medium and soft foam and in turn were larger
              on the medium foam compared with the soft foam with eyes closed.
              Moreover, GLM and correlation analysis demonstrated that the
              properties of the foam blocks affected anteroposterior torque
              variance >0.1Hz and lateral torque variance in all frequency
              ranges. In addition, the stabilising effect of vision in the
              anteroposterior direction had a greater influence when the
              subjects' stability was increasingly challenged by the support
              surface, as illustrated by the higher torque variance values. In
              conclusion, caution should be taken when analysing balance
              deficits with foam test setups, because the foam properties may
              influence the recorded body movements.",

              rotations of the support surface while they simultaneously
              executed unilateral knee flexion. Combined pitch and roll
              rotations (7.5 degrees and 60 degrees/s) were presented randomly
              in six different directions. Subjects were tested in four stance
              conditions: balance perturbation only (PO); cued flexion of one
              knee only (KO); combined support surface rotation and cued (at
              rotation onset) flexion of the uphill knee, contralateral to tilt
              (CONT), or of the downhill knee, ipsilateral to tilt (IPS).
              Outcome measures were CoM motion and biomechanical and
              electromyography (EMG) responses of the legs, arms and trunk.
              Predicted measures (PO+KO) were compared with combined measures
              (CONT or IPS). Unilateral knee flexion of the uphill knee (CONT)
              provided considerable benefit in balance recovery. Subjects
              rotated their pelvis more to the uphill side than predicted.
              Downhill knee bending (IPS) also had a positive effect on CoM
              motion because of a greater than predicted simultaneous lateral
              shift of the pelvis uphill. KO leg muscle activity showed
              anticipatory postural activity (APA) with similar profiles to
              early balance correcting responses. Onsets of muscle responses
              and knee velocities were earlier for PO, CONT, and IPS compared
              to KO conditions. EMG response amplitudes for CONT and IPS
              conditions were generally not different from the PO condition and
              therefore smaller than predicted. Later stabilizing responses at
              400 ms had activation amplitudes generally equal to those
              predicted from the PO+KO conditions. Our results suggest that
              because EMG patterns of anticipatory postural activity of
              voluntary unilateral knee flexion and early balance corrections
              have similar profiles, the CNS is easily able to incorporate
              voluntary activation associated with unilateral knee flexion into
              automatic postural responses. Furthermore, the effect on movement
              strategies appears to be non-linear. These findings may have
              important implications for the rehabilitation of balance

              pain changes the postural control and stability during quiet
              standing and after unexpected perturbations. METHODS: Nine
              subjects stood as quiet as possible on a movable force platform
              that recorded the centre of pressure position and provided
              unexpected floor perturbations, before, during and after
              experimental calf muscle pain. Bilateral surface electromyography
              from the tibialis anterior and medial gastrocnemius muscles was
              recorded. The foot pressure distributions were measured using
              pressure insoles. Intramuscular injections of hypertonic saline
              were administrated (right leg) to induce acute pain in the
              tibialis anterior and/or medial gastrocnemius muscles, and an
              isotonic injection was used as control. FINDINGS: Simultaneous
              pain in tibialis anterior and medial gastrocnemius altered the
              postural control. During quiet standing: higher medial-lateral
              centre of pressure speed and increased total sway displacement
              (P<0.05), weight moved to the non-painful side, (P<0.05) and
              plantar centre of pressure of the left foot was shifted towards
              the heel's direction (P<0.05). During forward perturbation:
              higher mean displacement in the medial-lateral direction
              (P<0.05). After the perturbation: larger sway area (P<0.05). Pain
              only in the medial gastrocnemius muscle increased medial-lateral
              centre of pressure speed (P<0.05) during the quiet standing. Pain
              only in the tibialis anterior muscle increased peak pressure on
              the contralateral foot (P<0.05). INTERPRETATION: These findings
              suggest that large acute painful areas on the calf muscles impair

              on the outstretched hands",
  author   = "Choi, W J and Robinovitch, S N",
  abstract = "Falls on the outstretched hands are the cause of over 90\% of
              wrist fractures, yet little is known about bone loading during
              this event. We tested how the magnitude and distribution of
              pressure over the palm region during a forward fall is affected
              by foam padding (simulating a glove) and arm configuration, and
              by the faller's body mass index (BMI) and thickness of soft
              tissues over the palm region. Thirteen young women with high
              (n=7) or low (n=6) BMI participated in a ``torso release
              experiment'' that simulated falling on both outstretched hands
              with the arm inclined either at 20° or 40° from the vertical.
              Trials were acquired with and without a 5 mm thick foam pad
              secured to the palm. Outcome variables were the magnitude and
              location of peak pressure (d, $\vartheta$) with respect to the
              scaphoid, total impact force, and integrated force applied to
              three concentric areas, including ``danger zone'' of 2.5 cm
              radius centered at the scaphoid. Soft tissue thickness over the
              palm was measured by ultrasound. The 5mm foam pad reduced peak
              pressure, and peak force to the danger zone, by 83\% and 13\%,
              respectively. Peak pressure was 77\% higher in high BMI when
              compared with low BMI participants. Soft tissue thickness over
              the palm correlated positively with distance (d) (R=0.79,
              p=0.001) and force applied outside the danger zone (R=0.76,
              p=0.002), but did not correlate with BMI (R=0.43, p=0.14). The
              location of peak pressure was shunted 4 mm further from the
              scaphoid at 20° than that of 40° falls (d=25 mm (SD 8),
              $\vartheta$=-9° (SD 17) in the 20° falls versus d=21 mm (SD 8),
              $\vartheta$=-5° (SD 24) in the 40° falls). Peak force to the
              entire palm was 11\% greater in 20° compared with 40° falls.
              These results indicate that even a 5 mm thick foam layer protects
              against wrist injury, by attenuating peak pressure over the palm
              during forward falls. Increased soft tissue thickness shunts
              force away from the scaphoid. However, soft tissue thickness is
              not predicted by BMI, and peak pressures are greater in high
              individuals than that of low BMI individuals. These results
              contribute to our understanding of the mechanics and prevention
              of wrist and hand injuries during falls.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: The purpose was to investigate two types of
              feed-forward postural adjustments associated with preparation to
              predictable external perturbations. METHODS: Nine subjects stood
              on a wedge, toes-up or toes-down while a pendulum impacted their
              shoulders. EMGs of leg and trunk muscles were analyzed within the
              framework of the uncontrolled manifold hypothesis. RESULTS: Early
              postural adjustments (EPAs) were seen 400-500 ms and anticipatory
              postural adjustments (APAs), 100-150 ms prior to the impact. EPAs
              and APAs were also seen in the time profiles of muscle modes
              representing muscle groups with linear scaling of the activation
              levels. Center of pressure shifts were stabilized by co-varied
              adjustments in muscle mode magnitudes across trials. The index of
              these multi-muscle synergies showed two drops (anticipatory
              synergy adjustments, ASAs), prior to EPA and APA in each subject.
              The findings were consistent between the two conditions.
              CONCLUSIONS: The results show that feed-forward postural
              adjustments represent a sequence of two phenomena, EPAs and APAs.
              Each of those is preceded by ASAs that reduce stability of a
              variable that is to be adjusted during the EPAs and APAs. The
              findings fit a hierarchical scheme with synergic few-to-many
              mappings at each level of the hierarchy based on the referent
              body configuration hypothesis. SIGNIFICANCE: The results show the
              complexity of the postural preparation to action. Potentially,

               Anticipatory postural adjustments represent an important
               mechanism of postural control which was expected to be changed
               in amputees because of both mechanical and secondary,
               neurological reasons.Methods. Six patients after a
               below-the-knee amputation and six control subjects stood on a
               force platform and performed fast bilateral shoulder movements
               and also dropped or caught a load from (into) extended hands.
               Anticipatory changes in the background activity of postural
               muscles were analysed.Results. In amputees, there were cases of
               marked asymmetry in anticipatory changes of the background
               muscle activity which were larger on the intact side of the body
               but were commonly small or absent on the side of the amputation.
               This asymmetry could lead to larger mediolateral forces and

               that asymmetrical patterns of anticipatory postural adjustments
               reflect central adaptive changes secondary to the amputation.

              this study was to determine if these boundaries correctly
              characterize empirical data. We analyzed 2367 trials from 10
              subjects who recovered their balance after they voluntarily
              pulled on a handle. We hypothesized that if model predictions

              trajectory's nearest distance to the torque boundaries (the
              torque safety margin) would be correlated with the center of
              pressure (COP) safety margin, defined as the COP's nearest
              distance to the edge of the feet. The results supported the

              populations greater than 200 000, in Japan, Taiwan, Spain, Italy,
              North America and England collected data on all amputations done
              between July 1995 and June 1997. Patients were identified from at
              least two data sources (to allow checks on ascertainment);
              denominator populations were based on census figures. RESULTS:
              The highest amputation rates were in the Navajo population (43.9
              per 100 000 population per year for first major amputation in
              men) and the lowest in Madrid, Spain (2.8 per 100 000 per year).
              The incidence of amputation rose steeply with age; most
              amputations occurred in patients over 60 years. In most centres
              the incidence was higher in men than women and the incidence of
              major amputations was greater than that of minor amputations.
              Diabetes was associated with between 25 and 90 per cent of
              amputations. CONCLUSION: Apart from the Navajo centre,
              differences in the known prevalence of diabetes could not account
              for the differences in overall incidence of amputation.
              Differences in the prevalence of peripheral vascular disease are
              likely to be important, but this and the role of other factors,

               transition from bipedal to monopodal stance. TTA failed to
               perform the task in a high percentage of trials both when the
               sound and the prosthetic limb were supporting. Significant
               differences were also found between TTA and controls in the
               duration of the weight transfer phase, in the length of the
               initial centre of pressure (CP) displacement and in the
               electromyographic (EMG) patterns. Despite adaptive posturomotor
               control strategies, transition from bipedal to monopodal stance
               remains a difficult task to perform for TTA, both when the
               supporting limb is the affected one and when the sound one is.

              of falling and fear of falling among lower extremity amputees.
              Arch Phys Med Rehabil 2001;82:1031-7. Objective: To estimate the
              falling experience and fear of falling status and to describe
              characteristics associated with falling and fear of falling.
              Design: Population-based consecutive sample survey and chart
              review. Setting: Two Canadian, regional, university-affiliated
              outpatient amputee clinics. Participants: The sample (n = 435;
              mean age, 62 $\pm$ 15.7yr) of community-living participants was
              mostly male (71\%), had unilateral (below knee 73\%; above knee
              27\%) amputations primarily for vascular (53\% vs 47\%
              nonvascular) reasons. Intervention: Review patient charts and
              survey questionnaires to determine sociodemographic information
              (eg, social support), information about the amputation (eg,
              cause, level, problems), physical health and function (eg, pain,
              limitations, comorbidity), and psychologic state (depression,
              adaptation). Main Outcome Measures: Occurrence of a fall in the
              past 12 months and presence of a fear of falling. Results:
              Exactly 52.4\% subjects reported falling in the past year,
              whereas 49.2\% reported a fear of falling. Logistic regression
              analyses revealed falling was related to having an above knee
              amputation (odds ratio [OR] = 2.78; 95\% confidence interval [CI]
              = 1.71-4.51), back (OR = 1.96; 95\% CI = 1.08-3.54) and joint (OR
              = 1.67; 95\% CI = 1.01-2.74) pain, and multiple stump and
              prosthesis problems (OR = 3.09; 95\% CI = 1.58-6.04). Having had
              the amputation $\geq$ 4 years in the past was protective (OR
              =.53; 95\% CI =.29-.89). Factors related to an increase risk of
              fear of falling included having to concentrate on each step while
              walking (OR = 4.06; 95\% CI = 2.46-6.71) and having a fall in the
              past 12 months (OR = 1.62; 95\% CI = 1.04-2.54), whereas being
              male (OR = 0.35; 95\% CI =.21-.57) and having good to excellent
              perceived health (OR =.35; 95\% CI =.21-.58) were protective.
              Conclusions: Falling and fear of falling are pervasive among
              amputees. Comprehensive and ongoing intervention and education
              should be considered. Research is required to assess the
              consequences of falling and fear of falling. \copyright{} 2001 by

              lower-limb amputees during quiet standing and under dynamic
              conditions. DESIGN: Center-of-pressure excursions during quiet
              standing and the standing balance performance on a single axis
              stabilimeter was assessed in six unilateral lower-limb amputees
              and six able-bodied controls. Stabilimeter trials were repeated
              with subjects standing so that pivoting occurred either in the
              anteroposterior or mediolateral direction or in the mediolateral
              direction but with vision occluded. RESULTS: Center-of-pressure
              excursions were significantly greater (P < 0.05) for amputees in
              both the mediolateral and anteroposterior directions. During all
              stabilimeter tests, amputees spent significantly less time in
              balance than able-bodied controls (P < 0.05), and this was
              attributed to a nonsignificant increase in the average time the
              stabilimeter spent in contact with the ground. Group differences
              in the average time of contact in the anteroposterior test

              Amputees had poorer static and dynamic balance than able-bodied
              controls. Amputees had a greater problem controlling dynamic
              balance in the anteroposterior direction than the mediolateral

               people with lower-limb amputations. The purposes of this study
               were to describe confidence in balance among people with
               transtibial or transfemoral lower-limb amputations and to
               compare people whose amputations were due to vascular and
               nonvascular causes. Subjects and Methods. A survey of a sample
               of 435 community-dwelling individuals from 2 regional clinics
               was conducted. The sample consisted of people with unilateral
               transfemoral (26.7\%) and transtibial (73.3\%) amputations who
               lost their limb for vascular (53\%) and nonvascular (47\%)
               reasons. The mean age of the primarily male (71\%) sample was
               62.0 years (SD=15.7). Results. Mean scores, using the
               Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale, were 63.8
               for the total sample, 54.1 for the subjects with amputations due
               to vascular reasons, and 74.7 for the subjects with amputations
               due to nonvascular reasons. Given a maximum possible ABC Scale
               score of 100, the results suggest that confidence was low. A
               difference between the subjects with amputations due to vascular
               reasons and those with amputations due to nonvascular reasons
               was observed over each item of the ABC Scale. Variables that
               were statistically related to balance confidence included age,
               sex, etiology, mobility device use, the need to concentrate
               while walking, limitations in activities of daily living,
               depression, and fear of falling. Discussion and Conclusion.
               Balance confidence scores among the study sample were low when
               compared with values previously reported by other researchers.
               Confidence was particularly low among individuals who had their
               amputation for vascular reasons. Balance confidence might be an
               important area of clinical concern.",

              amputee gait to develop more functional prostheses. The aim of
              this study is to quantitatively evaluate amputee gait by dynamic
              analysis of the musculoskeletal system during level walking and
              stair climbing. METHODS: Dynamic analysis using gait analysis,
              electromyography and musculoskeletal modeling for above-knee
              amputees (n=8) and healthy adults (n=10) was performed to
              evaluate the muscle balance, muscle force, and moment of each
              major muscle in each ambulatory task. Time-distance parameters
              and the kinematic parameter of gait analysis were calculated, and
              a root mean square electromyogram of major muscles and hamstring
              and tibialis anterior coactivity was measured using
              electromyography. Lastly, dynamic analyses of above-knee amputee
              gaits were performed using musculoskeletal models with scaled
              bones and redefined muscles for each subject. FINDINGS: Most
              kinematic parameters showed statistically no difference among the
              tasks, excluding pelvic tilt, pelvic obliquity, and hip
              abduction. Major muscle activities and coactivities of the
              hamstring and tibialis anterior showed that the stair ascent task
              needed more muscle activity than the stair descent task and level
              walking. The muscle activity and coactivity of amputees were
              greater than those of healthy subjects, excluding the hamstring
              coactivity during stair ascent (P<0.05). Lastly, dynamic analysis
              showed that weakened abductor and excessive adductor and then
              inadequate torque during all tasks were quantitatively observed.
              INTERPRETATION: Dynamic analysis of amputee gait enabled us to
              quantify the contribution of major muscles at the hip and knee
              joint mainly in daily ambulatory tasks of above-knee amputees and
              may be helpful in designing functional prostheses.",

  abstract = "Muscle vibration has been shown to induce long-lasting and
              oriented alteration of standing posture in healthy individuals.
              The postural alterations can last several minutes following the
              end of vibration and are called post-effects. The goal of this
              study was to determine whether persons with lower leg amputation
              that show persistent postural asymmetry after usual
              rehabilitation experience these postural post-effects and if this
              could improve their weight bearing on the prosthesis. Centre of
              pressure (CP) position during stance was recorded prior to and up
              to 13 min after a 30s unilateral vibration applied during sitting
              to lateral neck (trapezius) or hip (gluteus medius) muscles in 14
              individuals with unilateral lower leg amputation and 18 controls.
              The amputees' postural asymmetry was confirmed prior to the
              vibration intervention. A CP displacement, without an increase in
              CP velocity, was observed in both groups of participants over the
              13 min post-vibration. For both the neck or hip vibration sites,
              the CP shifts were directed in the medio-lateral plane and were
              oriented either towards the vibrated side or the opposite side
              across subjects. This led to a decrease of postural asymmetry in
              half of the group of amputees. Within subject, the orientation of
              the post-effect was constant and changed to the opposite
              direction with vibration of the opposite body side. It is
              suggested that the post-effects are produced by a change of the
              postural reference consequent to the sustained proprioceptive
              message induced during the muscle vibration period. The
              orientation of the post-effects is discussed in relation to the
              notion of reference frame preference. All in all, because
              post-effect orientation is constant within subject and adaptive,
              future studies should investigate if individuals with lower leg
              amputation could benefit from postural post-effects induced by
              muscle vibration to improve function.",

              transducers. Lateral CoM and XcoM position were computed by
              filtering the CoP data. Subjects were six above-knee amputees and
              six matched healthy controls. They walked at approximately 0.75,
              1, and 1.25m/s for 2min. Amputees showed asymmetric gait with
              shorter stance (60\%) at the prosthetic side versus 68\% at the
              non-prosthetic side and a wider stride (13+/-4cm, mean+/-S.D.)
              compared to controls (9+/-3cm). At foot placement CoP was just
              lateral to the XcoM. The margin between average CoP and XcoM at
              foot contact was only 1.6+/-0.7cm in controls, 2.7+/-0.5cm in
              amputees at the prosthetic side and 1.9+/-0.6cm at the
              non-prosthetic side. Next to this 'stepping strategy', CoP
              position was corrected after initial contact by modulating the
              lateral foot roll-off ('lateral ankle strategy') in
              non-prosthetic legs up to about 2cm. A simple mechanical model,
              the inverted pendulum model, can explain that: (1) a less precise
              foot placement (greater CoP-XcoM margin) results in a wider
              stride, (2) this effect can be reduced by walking with a higher
              cadence, and (3) a greater margin at one side, as with a leg
              prosthesis, should be compensated by a shorter stance duration at
              the same side to achieve a straight path. This suggests that not
              in all cases symmetric gait should be an aim of rehabilitation.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Microprocessor-controlled knee joints appeared on the
              market a decade ago. These joints are more sophisticated and more
              expensive than mechanical ones. The literature is contradictory
              regarding changes in gait and balance when using these
              sophisticated devices. METHODS: This study employed a crossover
              design to assess the comparative performance of a passive
              mechanical knee prosthesis compared to a
              microprocessor-controlled knee joint in 15 subjects with an
              above-knee amputation. Objective measurements of gait and balance
              were obtained. RESULTS: Subjects demonstrated significantly
              improved gait characteristics after receiving the
              microprocessor-controlled prosthetic knee joint (p<0.01).
              Improvements in gait were a transition from a hyperextended knee
              to a flexed knee during loading response which resulted in a
              change from an internal knee flexor moment to a knee extensor
              moment. The participants' balance also improved (p<0.01). All
              conditions of the Sensory Organization Test (SOT) demonstrated
              improvements in equilibrium score. The composite score also
              increased. CONCLUSIONS: Transfemoral amputees using a
              microprocessor-controlled knee have significant improvements in
              gait and balance.",

              different midsole hardnesses on dynamic balance control during
              unexpected gait termination. Twelve healthy young female adults
              were asked to walk along an 8-m walkway, looking straight ahead.
              During 25\% of the trials, they were signaled (via an audio
              buzzer) to terminate gait within the next two steps. The four
              experimental conditions were: (1) soft (A15); (2) standard (A33);
              (3) hard (A50); (4) barefoot. Center of mass (COM) position
              relative to the lateral base of support (BOS), center of
              mass-center of pressure (COM-COP) difference and vertical loading
              rate were used to evaluate the influence of midsole material on
              dynamic balance control. The results were a decrease in the
              medial-lateral range of COM with respect to the lateral BOS, a
              reduction in the maximum COM-COP difference and an increase in
              the vertical loading rate due to the presence and hardness level
              of the midsole material when compared to the barefoot condition.
              The primary outcomes of this study have illustrated the influence
              of midsole hardness as an impediment to dynamic balance control
              during responses to gait termination. In conclusion, the present
              study suggests that variations in midsole material and even the
              presence of it, impairs the dynamic balance control system.",

              limb amputees were randomised over intensive care (N = 29) and
              usual care (N = 29); this study was carried out in a clinical

              specific exercises, lasting approximately one hour altogether.
              Effects were assessed on: 2-minute walk test, physiological cost
              index (PCI), amount of weight bearing on both legs, 5 questions
              of the Functional Measure for Amputees questionnaire and the
              timed up and go test. Trans-tibial amputees were tested the first
              day they were fitted and then 2 days later; trans-femoral

              that moved in the anteroposterior direction was tested with eyes
              open, blindfolded and while performing a dual task. MAIN OUTCOME

              reaction force and centre of pressure shift. RESULTS: Compared to
              able-bodied subjects, in amputees the anteroposterior ground
              reaction force was larger in the prosthetic and non-affected
              limb, and the centre of pressure displacement was increased in
              the non-affected limb and decreased in the prosthetic limb. In
              amputees body weight was loaded more on the non-affected limb.

              increasing movements and loading in the non-affected limb. The

              prosthetic limb. To enable amputees to manage all possible

              MEASURES: Equilibrium and strategy scores on the SOT. Postural
              response latency and weight distribution on the MCT. RESULTS:
              Equilibrium scores were highest when somatosensory information
              was accurate, but there were no differences between the groups.
              Strategy scores were lower when visual cues and somatosensory
              information were inaccurate, and the fallers and nonfallers used
              a combination of ankle and hip strategies to prevent a loss of
              balance. The amputee nonfallers indicated they had a greater
              reliance on visual input even when it was inaccurate compared
              with the amputee fallers, whereas the control fallers used the
              hip strategy significantly more compared with the control
              nonfallers (SOT condition 6: 56+/-22 vs 72+/-10, P=.01). Weight
              distribution symmetry showed that the amputee nonfallers bore

              the amputee fallers during backward and forward translations
              (P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: The SOT and MCT appeared to be population
              specific and therefore did not reliably identify fallers among
              transtibial amputees or distinguish between community-dwelling
              control fallers and nonfallers. Amputee and control fallers can
              prevent a fall during challenging static and dynamic conditions
              by adapting their neuromuscular responses. The results from this

              adults. Twelve healthy elderly subjects (three males and nine

              balance rehabilitation laboratory to investigate changes between
              the feedback off and on conditions. Subjects were acutely exposed
              to a vibrotactile display that indicated the magnitude and
              direction of their body tilt from the vertical. DGI and
              mediolateral (ML) sway were determined during locomotion with,
              and without, vibrotactile tilt feedback (VTTF). All subjects were
              at risk for falls based on their initial DGI Score (range: 15-19,
              mean 17.4+/-1.56), which was taken with the vibratory stimulus
              turned off. Subjects learned to use the trunk tilt information
              from the vibrotactile feedback vest through 20-30 min of gait and
              balance training consisting of activities that challenged their
              balance. Subjects were then retested on the DGI. Statistically
              significant changes were demonstrated for the DGI total score
              while using the vibrotactile tilt feedback. DGI total scores
              improved from 17.1+/-0.4 to 20.8+/-0.3 (p<0.05). We conclude that
              vibrotactile tilt feedback improves both control of mediolateral
              sway during gait and dynamic gait index. Both are fall risk
              indicators for this population.",

              recovery of 17 unilateral transtibial amputees and 17 matched
              able-bodied controls after being released from a forward-inclined
              orientation of 10\%. Kinematic analysis revealed statistically
              significant differences in response time and knee flexion at
              heel-strike between both groups. However, there were no
              statistically significant differences in step length of the
              leading and trailing limb, swing time of the leading limb, and
              maximal knee flexion during swing. In the amputees, we found
              spatial and temporal differences when recovering with the sound
              versus prosthetic limb first. When leading with the prosthetic
              limb, they responded faster and also the interval between
              heel-strike of the leading and trailing limb was shorter.
              Furthermore, amputees made a longer step and showed less knee
              flexion at heel-strike when leading with the prosthetic limb.
              Interestingly, amputees as a group had no specific limb
              preference, prosthetic or sound, to recover after a forward fall,
              despite the asymmetry in their locomotor system. Analyses of
              dynamic stability (extrapolated center of mass) revealed that the
              amputees were equally efficient in recovering from an impending
              fall as controls, irrespective whether they lead with their
              prosthetic or sound limb. We suggest that in amputee
              rehabilitation, balance recovery after a fall should be trained
              with both sides, as this can increase confidence in fall-prone
              situations.",

              organization test (SOT) aiming at evaluating postural control in
              quiet stance and during movement. The patients were submitted to
              these evaluations after the disappearance of pain (TKR(1)) and at
              the end of a 6-week rehabilitation program (TKR(2)). Balance
              control being greatly improved at TKR2 compared to TKR1, the
              patients attain a quality of postural regulation similar to that
              of the controls; some postural abnormalities did however persist
              for the static test. Moreover, SOT values at TKR(2) close to
              those of the controls highlighted an improvement in motor
              response, better management in altered proprioceptive information

              neuroplasticity, the modification of muscular activation

              dysvascularity-induced unilateral tibial amputation in skilled
              prosthetic users (SPU) and first fitted amputees (FFA) (N = 28).
              METHODS: Excursions of center of pressure (COP) were determined
              during 20 s quiet standing using a stabilometry system with
              eyes-open on both legs or on the non-affected leg(s). MAIN
              MEASURES: COP trajectories and time functions; distribution of
              reaction forces between the two legs; inclination angles obtained
              through second order regression analysis using stabilogram data.
              RESULTS: FFA vs SPU demonstrated 27.8\% greater postural sway in
              bilateral stance (p = 0.0004). Postural sway area was smaller in
              FFA standing on the non-affected leg compared with SPU (p =
              0.028). The slope of the regression line indicating postural
              stability was nearly identical in FFA and SPU and the direction
              of regression line was opposite for the left and right leg
              amputees. CONCLUSION: Of the two adaptation strategies in
              balance, the first appears before amputation due to pain and
              fatigue in the affected leg. This strategy appears in the form of
              reduced postural sway while standing on the non-affected leg. The
              second adaptation occurs during rehabilitation and regular use of
              the prosthesis resulting in normal weightbearing associated with
              reduced postural sway on two legs and return to the normal
              postural stability on one leg.",

              (H1) phase, the amputated/intact was greater than the referent
              side. For power TT, for the peak power generation stance phase
              knee, the amputated was less than the referent side. For peak
              power generation swing phase knee, the amputated was less than
              the referent side. For the eccentric knee flexor (K4) phase, the
              amputated was less than the intact side. For the eccentric hip
              flexor (H2) phase, the amputated was greater than the intact
              side. For work TF, for the concentric plantar flexor (A2) phase,
              the referent was less than the intact side. For the H1 phase, the
              referent was less than the intact side. For the H2 phase, the
              amputated was greater than the intact/referent side, and the
              referent was greater than the intact side. For power TF, for the

              analysis did not alter the conclusions. CONCLUSIONS: Adaptations
              were seen in the amputated and intact legs. TT and TF use
              remarkably similar adaptation strategies at the level of the hip
              to compensate for the loss of plantar flexion power and
              facilitate forward progression. At the knee level, adaptations

              The centre-of-mass and centre-of-pressure margins of safety, and
              all centre-of-mass displacement rates, were not significantly
              lower for the two novel compliant flooring systems compared to
              the control floor. The centre-of-pressure displacement rates were
              similar to the control floor for the SmartCell floor condition.
              The majority of the margin of safety and displacement rate
              variables for the foam floors were significantly lower than the
              control condition. This study illustrates that the SmartCell and
              SofTile novel compliant floors have minimal influences on balance
              and balance control responses following externally induced
              perturbations in older community-dwelling women, and supports

              A pilot study involving a preintervention and postintervention
              design was conducted with measurements taken at baseline,
              immediately postintervention (week 5), and at follow-up (week 13)
              for retention. SETTING: University hospital outpatient clinic and
              participants' places of residence. PARTICIPANTS: Children and
              adolescents with unilateral lower limb amputation (n=6; 3
              transfemoral [TF] and 3 Van Ness) and age-matched, typically
              developing individuals (n=10) for baseline comparison.
              INTERVENTION: Two videogames involving weight shifting in
              standing were each played at home for 20 min/d, 4d/wk for a
              period of 4 weeks. A physical therapist provided initial
              instruction and monitoring. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Postural
              control characteristics using center of pressure (COP)
              displacements during quiet standing; functional balance using the
              Community Balance and Mobility Scale (CB\&M); and compliance,
              safety, and feasibility using custom questionnaires. RESULTS:
              Average playing times for the first 3 weeks ranged from 16.0 to
              21.1 minutes for the 2 games. At baseline, the children and
              adolescents with TF amputation had substantially greater COP
              displacements than the Van Ness group and typically developing
              children and adolescents. Immediately postintervention, the COP
              displacements decreased in the TF amputees, resulting in values
              that were closer to those of the typically developing children.
              The average increase in CB\&M score from baseline to follow-up
              was 6 points across participants. CONCLUSIONS: In-home,
              videogame-based balance training therapies can achieve excellent
              compliance in children and adolescents with lower limb
              amputation. With proper instructions and monitoring, the
              therapeutic intervention can be safely administered. Some
              improvements in postural control characteristics were seen in
              children and adolescents with balance deficits immediately
              postintervention, but long-term retention remains unclear.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Regaining effective postural control after lower limb
              amputation requires complex adaptation strategies in both the
              prosthesis side and the non-amputated side. The objective in this
              study is to determine the individual contribution of the ankle
              torques generated by both legs in balance control during dynamic
              conditions. METHODS: Subjects (6 transfemoral and 8 transtibial
              amputees) stood on a force platform mounted on a motion platform
              and were instructed to stand quietly. The experiment consisted of
              1 static and 3 perturbation trials of 90 s duration each. The
              perturbation trials consisted of continuous randomized sinusoidal
              platform movements of different amplitude in the sagittal plane.
              Weight distribution during the static and dynamic perturbation
              trials was calculated by dividing the average vertical force
              below the prosthesis foot by the sum of forces below both feet.
              The Dynamic Balance Control represents the ratio between the
              stabilizing mechanism of the prosthetic leg and the stabilizing
              mechanism of the non-amputated leg. The stabilizing mechanism is
              calculated from the corrective ankle torque in response to sway.
              The relationship between the prosthetic ankle stiffness and the
              performance during the platform perturbations was calculated.
              FINDINGS: All patients showed a (non-significant) weight bearing
              asymmetry in favor of the non-amputated leg. The Dynamic Balance
              Control ratio showed that the contribution of both legs to
              balance control was even more asymmetrical. Moreover, the actual
              balance contribution of each leg was not tightly coupled to
              weight bearing in each leg, as was the case in healthy controls.
              There was a significant positive correlation between the
              prosthetic ankle stiffness and the Dynamic Balance Control.
              INTERPRETATION: The Dynamic Balance Control provides, in addition
              to weight distribution, information to what extent the
              stabilizing mechanism of the corrective ankle torque of both legs
              contributes to balance control. Knowledge of the stiffness
              properties may optimize the prescription process of prosthetic
              foot in lower leg amputee subjects in relation to standing
              stability.",

              derived from center of pressure (COP) time series, and measures
              obtained from non-linear stabilogram diffusion analyses, were

              measures of postural control (95\% ellipse area, RMS distance,

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Lower-limb amputation is mainly a result of trauma,
              vascular disease, diabetes, or congenital disorders. Persons with
              amputation lose their ability to stand and walk on the basis of
              the level of amputation. Contribution of level of amputation,
              type of amputation, or cause of amputation to balance impairment
              has not been clearly defined. Furthermore, it is controversial
              how much the mentioned parameters influence standing stability.
              Therefore, the aim of this review article was to find the
              relationship between the abovementioned factors and balance
              impairment in the available literature. It was also aimed to find
              the possibility of improving standing stability by the use of
              different prosthesis components. DESIGN: An electronic search was
              done via the PubMed, EMBASE, and ISI Web of Knowledge databases
              from 1960 to 2012. Quality of the articles was assessed using the
              Downs and Black tool. RESULTS: On the basis of the used key
              words, 100 articles were found, of which 20 articles were
              selected in accordance with the selection criteria. The scores of
              reporting, external validity, internal validity (bias), and
              internal validity (confounding) varied between 4-9, 1-3, 3-5, and
              2-6, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The literature review confirmed
              that standing stability of amputees depends on level of
              amputation, type of amputation, and cause of amputation.
              Moreover, prosthetic characteristics such as prosthetic ankle
              stiffness have influences on dynamic stability, whereas torsional
              adaptor does not have any positive influence on stability during
              level walking and on turning stability. Therefore, it can be
              concluded that the stability of a person with amputation can be
              improved by the use of appropriate prosthesis components.",

              MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: For the LOS test, the maximum excursion,
              endpoint excursion, direction control, movement velocity, and
              reaction time with inclination in the forward direction, toward
              the amputated leg/right leg, and in the backward direction, and

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Deficits in balance control are one of the most
              common and serious mobility challenges facing individuals with
              lower limb loss. Yet, dynamic postural balance control among
              individuals with lower limb loss remains poorly understood. Here
              we examined the kinematics and kinetics of dynamic balance in
              individuals with unilateral transtibial limb loss. METHODS: Five
              individuals with unilateral transtibial limb loss, and five age-
              and gender-matched controls completed a series of randomly
              applied multi-directional support surface translations.
              Whole-body metrics, e.g. peak center-of-mass displacement and net
              center-of-pressure displacement were compared across cohorts.
              Stability margin was computed as the difference between peak
              center-of-pressure and center-of-mass displacement. Additionally,
              center-of-pressure and ground reaction force magnitude and
              direction were compared between the prosthetic, intact, and
              control legs. FINDINGS: Peak center-of-mass displacement and
              stability margin did not differ between individuals with
              transtibial limb loss and controls for all perturbation
              directions except those loading only the prosthetic leg; in such
              cases the stability margin was actually larger than controls.
              Despite similar center-of-mass displacement, greater
              center-of-pressure displacement was observed in the intact leg
              during anterior-posterior perturbations, and under the prosthetic
              leg in medial-lateral perturbations. Further, in the prosthetic
              leg, ground reaction forces were smaller and spanned fewer
              directions. INTERPRETATION: Deficits in balance control among
              individuals with transtibial limb loss may be due to their
              inability to use their prosthetic leg to generate forces that are
              equal in magnitude and direction to those of unimpaired adults.
              Targeting this force-generating deficit through technological or
              rehabilitation innovations may improve balance control.",

              velocities may cause patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) to be
              more unstable for fast rather than slow balance perturbations.
              Such deficits could lead to reduced proprioceptive amplitude
              feedback triggered by perturbations, and thereby to smaller or
              delayed stabilizing postural responses. For this reason, we
              investigated whether support surface perturbation velocity
              affects balance reactions in PD patients. We examined postural
              responses of seven PD patients (OFF medication) and eight
              age-matched controls following backward rotations of a
              support-surface platform. Rotations occurred at three different
              speeds: fast (60 deg/s), medium (30 deg/s) or slow (3.8 deg/s),
              presented in random order. Each subject completed the protocol
              under eyes open and closed conditions. Full body kinematics,
              ankle torques and the number of near-falls were recorded.
              Patients were significantly more unstable than controls following
              fast perturbations (26\% larger displacements of the body's
              centre of mass; P<0.01), but not following slow perturbations.
              Also, more near-falls occurred in patients for fast rotations.
              Balance correcting ankle torques were weaker for patients than
              controls on the most affected side, but were stronger than
              controls for the least affected side. These differences were
              present both with eyes open and eyes closed (P<0.01). Fast
              support surface rotations caused greater instability and
              discriminated Parkinson patients better from controls than slow
              rotations. Although ankle torques on the most affected side were
              weaker, patients partially compensated for this by generating
              larger than normal stabilizing torques about the ankle joint on
              the least affected side. Without this compensation, instability
              may have been greater.",

              OBJECTIVE: To analyze the ability to voluntarily move the COG to
              positions within the limits of stability in a sample of subjects
              with traumatic UTA. DESIGN: Observational, case-control study.
              SETTING: University department. PARTICIPANTS: Ten men with
              traumatic UTA and 10 control subjects without amputation. MAIN
              OUTCOME MEASURES: Computerized dynamic posturography SMART
              EquiTEST System version 8.0 was used for measuring stability
              limits in both groups. The Limits of Stability test was used to
              assess the participants' ability to voluntarily sway to various
              locations in space (8 predetermined target positions). RESULTS:
              End point excursion achieved statistically significant
              differences in the prosthetic (P = .02) and backward (P = .03)
              directions in the subjects with UTA. A statistically significant
              decrease was observed in the maximum excursion to backward
              direction (P = .05) in the subjects with UTA. Directional control
              only reached statistically significant differences in the
              prosthetic backward direction (P = .05) compared with the control
              group. Movement velocity was statistically significantly lower in
              the subjects with UTA toward prosthetic (P = .03), backward (P =

              relation to the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Persons with
              traumatic UTA have a reduced ability to move their COG within
              stability limits (restricted displacement, inadequate directional
              control, and reduced velocity). These findings should be

              limb balancing on narrow ridges in transtibial amputees. When
              balancing on the prosthetic limb, the lateral displacement of the

              Standing on a prosthetic limb involves the same balance

              Yet, the ability to balance on a narrow ridge with the sound limb

              a closed hydraulic loop around the damping cylinder in the knee

              operating valves controlling the resistance to flow around a

  abstract = "Doubt about the role of stretch reflexes in movement and posture
              control has remained in part because the questions of reflex
              ``usefulness'' and the postural ``set'' have not been adequately
              considered in the design of experimental paradigms. The intent of
              this study was to discover the stabilizing role of stretch
              reflexes acting upon the ankle musculature while human subjects
              performed stance tasks requiring several different postural
              ``sets''. Task specific differences of reflex function were
              investigated by experiments in which the role of stretch reflexes
              to stabilize sway doing stance could be altered to be useful, of
              no use, or inappropriate. Because the system has available a
              number of alternate inputs to posture (e.g., vestibular and
              visual), stretch reflex responses were in themselves not
              necessary to prevent a loss of balance. Nevertheless, 5 out of 12
              subjects in this study used long-latency (120 msec) stretch
              reflexes to help reduce postural sway. Following an unexpected
              change in the usefulness of stretch reflexes, the 5 subjects
              progressively altered reflex gain during the succeeding 3-5
              trials. Adaptive changes in gain were always in the sense to
              reduce sway, and therefore could be attenuating or facilitating
              the reflex response. Comparing subjects using the reflex with
              those not during so, stretch reflex control resulted in less
              swaying when the task conditions were unchanging. However, the 5
              subjects using reflex controls oftentimes swayed more during the
              first 3-5 trials after a change, when inappropriate responses
              were elicited. Four patients with clinically diagnosed cerebellar
              deficits were studied briefly. Among the stance tasks, their
              performance was similar to normal in some and significantly
              poorer in others. Their most significant deficit appeared to be
              the inability to adapt long-latency reflex gain following changes
              in the stance task. The study concludes with a discussion of the
              role of stretch reflexes within a hierarchy of controls ranging
              from muscle stiffness up to centrally initiated responses.",

              corrections for normal subjects in the roll and pitch planes",
  author   = "Carpenter, Mark G and Allum, J H J and Honegger, Flurin",
  abstract = "A large body of evidence has been collected which describes the
              response parameters associated with automatic balance corrections
              in man to perturbations in the pitch plane. However,
              perturbations to human stance can be expected from multiple
              directions. The purpose of the present study was to describe the
              directional sensitivities of muscle responses re-establishing
              disturbed stance equilibrium in normal subjects. The
              contributions of stretch reflex and automatic balance-correcting
              responses to balance control, and concomitant biomechanical
              reactions, were examined for combinations of pitch and roll
              perturbations of the support surface. More specifically, muscle
              responses, initial head accelerations and trunk velocities were
              analyzed with the intention of identifying possible origins of
              directionally specific triggering signals and to examine how
              sensory information is used to modulate triggered balance
              corrections with respect to direction. Fourteen healthy adults
              were required to stand on a dual-axis rotating platform capable
              of delivering rotational perturbations with constant amplitude
              (7.5°) and velocity (50°/s) through multiple directions in the
              pitch and roll planes. Each subject was randomly presented with
              44 support surface rotations through 16 different directions
              separated by 22.5° first under eyes-open, and then, for a second
              identical set of rotations, under eyes-closed conditions.
              Bilateral muscle activities from tibialis anterior, soleus,
              lateral quadriceps and paraspinals were recorded, averaged across
              direction, and areas calculated over intervals with significant
              bursts of activity. Trunk angular velocity and ankle torque data
              were averaged over intervals corresponding to significant
              biomechanical events. Stretch reflex (intervals of 40--100,
              80--120 ms) and automatic balance-correcting responses (120--220,
              240--340 ms) in the same muscle were sensitive to distinctly
              different directions. The directions of the maximum amplitude of
              balance-correcting activity in leg muscles were oriented along
              the pitch plane, approximately 180° from the maximum amplitude of
              stretch responses. Ankle torques for almost all perturbation
              directions were also aligned along the pitch plane. Stretch
              reflexes in paraspinal muscles were tuned along the 45° plane but
              at 90° to automatic balance corrections and 180° to unloading
              responses in the same muscle. Stretch reflex onsets in paraspinal
              muscles were observed at 60 ms, as early as those of soleus
              muscles. In contrast, unloading reflexes in released paraspinal
              muscles were observed at 40 ms for perturbations which caused
              roll of the trunk towards the recorded muscle. Onsets of trunk
              roll velocities were earlier and more rapid than those observed
              for pitch velocities. Trunk pitch occurred for pure roll
              directions but not vice versa. When considered together, early
              stretch and unloading of paraspinals, and concomitant roll and
              pitch velocities of the trunk requiring a roll-and-pitch-based
              hip torque strategy, bring into question previous hypotheses of
              an ankle-based trigger signal or ankle-based movement strategies
              for postural balance reactions. These findings are compatible
              with the hypothesis that stretch-, force- and joint-related
              proprioceptive receptors at the level of the trunk provide a
              directionally sensitive triggering mechanism underlying a,
              minimally, two-stage (pitch-based leg and pitch-and-roll-based
              trunk) balance-correcting strategy. Accelerometer recordings from
              the head identified large vertical linear accelerations only for
              pitch movements and angular roll accelerations only during roll
              perturbations with latencies as early as 15 ms. Thus, it appears
              that balance corrections in leg and trunk muscles may receive
              strong, receptor-dependent (otolith or vertical canal) and
              directionally sensitive amplitude-modulating input from
              vestibulospinal signals.",

              represents the distance between the center of pressure and the
              center of mass, was measured from two force platforms and three

              the COP-COM were .79 in the anterior-posterior (AP) direction and
              .69 in mediolateral (ML) direction. With four trials, the COP-COM

               older adults with a history of 2 or more falls in the previous 6

               Methods. Time taken to complete the TUG under 3 conditions (TUG,
               TUG with a subtraction task [TUGcognitive], and TUG while
               carrying a full cup of water [TUGmanual]) was measured. A
               multivariate analysis of variance and discriminant function and

              municipality 7,543 community-dwelling persons aged 66+ years,
              were offered participation in one of three intervention programs:
              2,550 persons were offered a home safety inspection, evaluation
              of prescribed medicine, and identification of possible health and
              food problems (Program I); 2,445 persons were offered 1000 mg of
              elemental calcium and 400 IU (10 microg) of vitamin D(3) per day
              in combination with evaluation of prescribed medicine (Program
              II); and 2,548 persons were offered a combination of the two
              programs (Program III). Acceptance was defined as willingness to
              receive an introductory visit by a nurse. RESULTS: Acceptance of
              Program I was 50\%; of Program II, 56\% (P < 0.00005 as
              contrasted with Program I); and of Program III, 46\% (P < 0.005).
              Acceptance was associated with gender (females, 53\%; males,
              47\%) and did not change from ages 66 to 84 but decreased
              significantly after the age of 85. Widows aged 66-84 had the
              highest acceptance (57\%) and never married males aged 66-84 the
              lowest (30\%). An important determinant, however, was the

              program. Acceptance varied from 39 to 66\% between the social
              centers. CONCLUSIONS: Acceptance of a fall and fracture
              prevention program varies with intervention type; with gender,
              age, and social status of the target population; and with the

              combination of two corresponding AP and ML perturbations. In
              contrast the observed averaged ankle NJT (ML) responses did not
              follow the same similarity. The comparison of the averaged ankle
              and hip sum NJT (ML) responses revealed that the time courses of
              the responses elicited by a perturbation acting only in the ML
              direction were identical to those elicited by a combination of
              two corresponding AP and ML perturbations. These findings were
              invariable of the experimental conditions and were consistent
              among all the eight subjects. Thereby, we conclude that the ankle
              sum NJT (AP) and the ankle and hip sum NJT (ML) are the global
              variables being controlled. This shows that CNS controls the
              recovery from the multiple direction perturbations of moderate
              strength by decoupling the AP-ML postural space into two
              orthogonal directions (AP and ML).",

              to ageing and disease on the postural control system and also to
              examine the relationship between functional performance and
              postural sway. Seventy healthy subjects, eight patients with
              Parkinson's disease and nine people with a history of falls took
              part in the study. It was found that the quantitative
              posturography system was able to identify changes in the postural
              control system due to both the ageing process and disease. Also a
              moderate correlation coefficient was found between the sway

              whether postural regulation in falling workers might have
              specificities in terms of sensorimotor strategies and
              neuromuscular responses to balance perturbations. Nine
              multi-fall-victims (MF), 43 single-fall-victims (SF) and 52
              controls (C) were compared on performance measurements of static
              and dynamic postural control. MF and SF had the worst postural
              performance both in the static and slow dynamic tests,
              particularly in eyes closed conditions, suggesting a high
              dependency on visual cues and a lower use of proprioception.
              Moreover, the sensorial analysis showed that MF and SF relied
              less on vestibular input in the development of balance strategy
              and had more difficulties in maintaining a correct upright stance
              when proprioceptive input was altered. Finally, MF showed longer
              latency responses to unexpected external disturbance. Overall,
              postural control quality increased in the order MF, SF and C. MF
              and SF adopted particular sensorimotor organisation, placing them
              at an increased risk of falling in specific sensory environments.
              Strategies incorporating visual information involve using the
              cognitive processes causing delayed and less accurate fall

  abstract = "Influencing the safety of firefighters' work environment is
              almost impossible. Therefore, good individual physical capacities
              and adequate protective equipment are important in preventing
              accidents due to slips and falls. This study investigated slip
              and fall risk in walking experiments with firefighters wearing
              fire-protective equipment and determined the associations of
              balance, muscular capacities and age with the risk of slipping.
              Professional male firefighters aged 33--38 and 43--56 years (n=14
              and n=15, respectively) participated in four slipping trials
              under different conditions on a straight path of 8 meters. Slip
              distances were measured in each trial. Postural balance and
              dynamic stability were tested on a force platform, and functional
              balance was measured during walking on a wooden plank. Muscular
              capacity of the legs and trunk were also measured. The average
              slip distances with glycerol were 9.7$\pm$9.1cm (100steps/min)
              and 15.6$\pm$18.2cm (120steps/min) in the 33-to-38-year age group
              and correspondingly 10.8$\pm$15.3cm and 18.0$\pm$18.6cm in the
              43--56-year age group. Though the older firefighters tended to
              have longer and more serious slips than the younger ones, the
              differences in slip distances were not statistically significant.
              Half of the firefighters, regardless of their age, experienced
              critical, over 5-cm long, foot slides, considered to increase the
              risk of an unavoidable fall. These firefighters performed
              significantly poorer in the dynamic stability test as well,
              whereas associations with muscular capacity and risk of slipping
              were not significant. The results suggest that the ability to
              exploit visual feedback efficiently in balance control may be
              associated with smaller risk of slipping. This kind of test may
              be useful in evaluations of balance ability. The findings also
              support the importance of adding exercises which enhance balance
              ability to the exercise protocols of firefighters.",

              for hospital, emergency department (ED), and outpatient clinic
              treatments for unintentional falls among older adults. RESULTS: A
              fall on the same level due to slipping, tripping, or stumbling
              was the most common mechanism of injury (28\%). Mean
              hospitalisation cost was 17,483 US dollars(S.D.: 22,426 US
              dollars) in 2004 US dollars. Femur fracture was the most
              expensive type of injury (18,638 US dollars, S.D.: 19,990 US
              dollars). The mean reimbursement cost of an ED visit was 236 US
              dollars and 412 US dollars for an outpatient clinic visit.

              Iranian Multicenter Study on Accidental Injuries, a prospective
              population-based study conducted in 9 provinces of Iran in 2003.
              All the hospitals serving about 9.5 million people in the study
              area were prospectively surveyed for any incident injury
              resulting from accidental events. A total of 2,186 patients
              (1,372 male, 814 female) were admitted due to any injurious fall
              events, where 572 (26.2\%) of them suffered a hip fracture.
              Annual incidence rates of injurious fall events and related hip
              fractures were 116.3 and 30.4 per 100,000 person-years,
              respectively. These figures were 237.1 and 93.6 per 100,000
              person-years for people over the age of 50 years, respectively.
              71\% of fall injuries and 76\% of hip fractures occurred indoors.
              Among 450 patients with hip fractures >or=50 years of age, 61.8\%
              arose from a fall from standing height or less. Only 1 in these
              450 hip fractures occurred at the time of recreational activity.
              In multivariate logistic regression analysis, no factor was an
              independent predictor of hip fractures comparing to other
              fall-related injuries among younger participants (>or=20 and <50
              years). For older patients, falls from standing height or loss
              (odds ratio (OR) = 2.67), falls during walking (OR = 1.71), and
              falls on stairs (OR = 1.73) were detected as risk factors of hip
              fracture. Married persons and those falling from a ladder or
              other elevations were less likely to fracture their hip in this
              age group. Our data suggest that modification of the factors
              external to the homes is less likely to prevent more than a small
              proportion of fall-related hip fractures in Iran. Further studies
              on this topic have potential applications for developing
              preventive strategies.",

  abstract = "Postural stability becomes compromised with advancing age, but
              the neural mechanisms contributing to instability have not been
              fully explicated. Accordingly, this quantitative physiological
              and MRI study of sex differences across the adult age range
              examined the association between components of postural control
              and the integrity of brain structure and function under different
              conditions of sensory input and stance stabilization
              manipulation. The groups comprised 28 healthy men (age 30-73
              years) and 38 healthy women (age 34-74 years), who completed
              balance platform testing, cognitive assessment, and structural
              MRI. The results supported the hypothesis that excessive postural
              sway would be greater in older than younger healthy individuals
              when standing without sensory or stance aids, and that
              introduction of such aids would reduce sway in both principal
              directions (anterior-posterior and medial-lateral) and in both
              the open-loop and closed-loop components of postural control even
              in older individuals. Sway reduction with stance stabilization,
              that is, standing with feet apart, was greater in men than women,
              probably because older men were less stable than women when
              standing with their feet together. Greater sway was related to
              evidence for greater brain structural involutional changes,
              indexed as ventricular and sulcal enlargement and white matter
              hyperintensity burden. In women, poorer cognitive test
              performance related to less sway reduction with the use of
              sensory aids. Thus, aging men and women were shown to have
              diminished postural control, associated with cognitive and brain
              structural involution, in unstable stance conditions and with
              diminished sensory input.",

              walking surface during the swing phase of the gait cycle. MFC is
              a gait variable that is linked to the mechanism of a trip because
              reduced MFC for a given step during walking increases the
              susceptibility to tripping on an unseen obstacle or due to
              undetected changes in surface height. Given that tripping is a
              common cause of falls in older persons, this review was
              undertaken to determine whether ageing and/or history of falls in
              older adults influences MFC characteristics during level walking.
              Studies that assessed MFC characteristics including measures of
              central tendency (mean and/or median), variability (linear and

              the hospital. Before the first evaluation, subject's levels of
              anxiety, depression and stress were assessed. Then, the area of
              body sway, velocity and medial-lateral and antero-posterior
              amplitudes were recorded twice, first with the subject's eyes
              opened and then with eyes closed. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The
              posturographic data obtained in hospital and at home were quite
              similar. However, when the group that was first evaluated in
              hospital was compared with the group first evaluated at home, the
              medio-lateral amplitude was observed to significantly decrease in
              the second evaluation compared with the data obtained in the
              first trial (P<0.05), and this decrease was significantly higher
              in the first group (P<0.05). For the eyes-opened condition, we
              found significant correlations between anxiety and the area of
              body sway, stress and the area of body sway, and anxiety and the
              medial-lateral amplitude. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological factors may
              influence some posturographic data, and carrying out
              posturographic evaluations at home for elderly subjects could be
              a reasonable strategy.",

  abstract = "Background The computerized dynamic posturography has been widely
              used to access balance control in patients with balance
              dysfunction. A composite-equilibrium score (CS) can be calculated
              from the sensory organization test using the computerized dynamic
              posturography. However, the correlation between the composite
              equilibrium score and clinical tests and its ability to predict
              falls has rarely been explored in the past. Methods A total of 60
              patients with chief complaint of dizziness were enrolled in our
              study, and clinical assessments were done including the sensory
              organization test (SOT), Timed Up and Go test (TUG), Tinetti
              Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment (POMA), and the dynamic
              gait index (DGI). The age and the subjective feeling of the
              severity of dizziness quantified by the visual analog scale (VAS)
              of each patient were also recorded. Results Statistical analysis
              revealed significant correlation between the composite
              equilibrium score and the TUG, POMA (gait, balance and total
              scores), and the DGI. However, there is statistically significant
              correlation between neither the CS and the age nor the VAS of
              dizziness. When grouping the DGI, POMA (total score), and the TUG
              cutoff to predict fall risks, the correlations to the CS can
              still be established except the TUG. Conclusion From the results
              of our study, the validity of the clinical tests was established
              in assessment of balance function, and clinicians can utilize
              these tools for preliminary evaluation of patient balance when
              computerized dynamic posturography is not available. In addition,
              CS can be used to predict the risk of falls.",

              (F) and recurrent fallers (RF>2 falls). Each subject was assessed
              by measurements of cognition and functional ability. Static
              posturography tests were performed in five conditions: with eyes
              open/close (EO/EC) on a firm/compliant (FS/CS) surface and while

              in the EOFS, ECFS and EOCS conditions (P<0.05). RMS displacements
              were also associated with the fall-history in the EOCS condition
              (P<0.05). Significant group differences (P<0.05) were found in
              the EOCS conditions, which greatly enhanced the differences among
              NF, F and RF. The ability to control balance while standing with
              eyes open on a compliant surface showed a high degree of

              falling. Postural sway was measured in 161 elderly individuals

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The effects of balance training (BT) in older adults
              on proxies of postural control and mobility are well documented
              in the literature. However, evidence-based dose-response
              relationships in BT modalities (i.e., training period, training
              frequency, training volume) have not yet been established in
              healthy older adults. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this
              systematic literature review and meta-analysis are to quantify BT
              intervention effects and to additionally characterize
              dose-response relationships of BT modalities (e.g., training
              period, training frequency) through the analysis of randomized
              controlled trials (RCTs) that could maximize improvements in
              balance performance in healthy community-dwelling older adults.
              DATA SOURCES: A computerized systematic literature search was
              performed in the electronic databases PubMed and Web of Science
              from January 1985 up to January 2015 to capture all articles
              related to BT in healthy old community-dwelling adults. STUDY
              ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: A systematic approach was used to evaluate
              the 345 articles identified for initial review. Only RCTs were
              included if they investigated BT in healthy community-dwelling
              adults aged $\geq$65 years and tested at least one behavioral
              balance performance outcome (e.g., center of pressure
              displacements during single-leg stance). In total, 23 studies met
              the inclusionary criteria for review. STUDY APPRAISAL AND
              SYNTHESIS METHODS: Weighted mean standardized mean differences
              between subjects (SMDbs) of the intervention-induced adaptations
              in balance performance were calculated using a random-effects
              model and tested for an overall intervention effect relative to
              passive controls. The included studies were coded for the
              following criteria: training modalities (i.e., training period,
              training frequency, training volume) and balance outcomes
              [static/dynamic steady-state (i.e., maintaining a steady position
              during standing and walking), proactive balance (i.e.,
              anticipation of a predicted perturbation), reactive balance
              (i.e., compensation of an unpredicted perturbation) as well as
              balance test batteries (i.e., combined testing of different
              balance components as for example the Berg Balance Scale)].
              Heterogeneity between studies was assessed using I2 and
              Chi2-statistics. The methodological quality of each study was
              tested by means of the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro)
              Scale. RESULTS: Weighted mean SMDbs showed that BT is an
              effective means to improve static steady-state (mean SMDbs =
              0.51), dynamic steady-state (mean SMDbs = 0.44), proactive (mean
              SMDbs = 1.73), and reactive balance (mean SMDbs = 1.01) as well
              as the performance in balance test batteries (mean SMDbs = 1.52)
              in healthy older adults. Our analyses regarding dose-response
              relationships in BT revealed that a training period of 11-12
              weeks (mean SMDbs= 1.26), a frequency of three training sessions
              per week (mean SMDbs= 1.20), a total number of 36-40 training
              sessions (mean SMDbs = 1.39), a duration of a single training
              session of 31-45 min (mean SMDbs = 1.19), and a total duration of
              91-120 min of BT per week (mean SMDbs = 1.93) of the applied
              training modalities is most effective in improving overall
              balance performance. However, it has to be noted that effect
              sizes for the respective training modalities were computed
              independently (i.e., modality specific). Because of the small
              number of studies that reported detailed information on training
              volume (i.e., number of exercises per training session, number of
              sets and/or repetitions per exercise, duration of single-balance
              exercises) dose-response relationships were not computed for
              these parameters. LIMITATIONS: The present findings have to be
              interpreted with caution because we indirectly compared
              dose-response relationships across studies using SMDbs and not in
              a single controlled study as it is difficult to separate the
              impact of a single training modality (e.g., training frequency)
              from that of the others. Moreover, the quality of the included
              studies was rather limited with a mean PEDro score of 5 and the
              heterogeneity between studies was considerable (i.e., I2 = 76-92
              \%). CONCLUSIONS: Our detailed analyses revealed that BT is an
              effective means to improve proxies of static/dynamic
              steady-state, proactive, and reactive balance as well as
              performance in balance test batteries in healthy older adults.
              Furthermore, we were able to establish effective BT modalities to
              improve balance performance in healthy older adults. Thus,
              practitioners and therapists are advised to consult the
              identified dose-response relationships of this systematic
              literature review and meta-analysis. However, further research of
              high methodologic quality is needed to determine (1)
              dose-response relationships of BT in terms of detailed
              information on training volume (e.g., number of exercises per
              training session) and (2) a feasible and effective method to
              regulate training intensity in BT.",

              electroencephalography (EEG) to measure electrocortical dynamics
              during human locomotion and other types of movement. Motion
              artifacts corrupt the EEG and mask underlying neural signals of
              interest. The cause of motion artifacts in EEG is often
              attributed to electrode motion relative to the skin, but few
              studies have examined EEG signals under head motion. In the
              current study, we tested how motion artifacts are affected by the
              overall mass and surface area of commercially available
              electrodes, as well as how cable sway contributes to motion
              artifacts. To provide a ground-truth signal, we used a gelatin
              head phantom with embedded antennas broadcasting electrical
              signals, and recorded EEG with a commercially available electrode
              system. A robotic platform moved the phantom head through
              sinusoidal displacements at different frequencies (0-2 Hz).

              additional questions about the validity of this disorder in
              adults. The goal of this article is to explore whether ADHD is a
              valid clinical entity in female subjects and whether it is
              expressed differently in male and female adults. To this end, we
              examined the clinical, cognitive, and functional characteristics
              of 128 referred adult ADHD cases of both sexes. Each subject had
              a clinical diagnosis of childhood-onset ADHD confirmed by
              structured interview. The male and female ADHD adults were
              similar to one another but more disturbed and impaired than
              non-ADHD adult control subjects. Compared with normal control
              females, ADHD women had higher rates of major depression, anxiety
              disorders, and conduct disorder; and more evidence of school
              failure and cognitive impairment. The consistency of these
              findings in both genders further supports the validity of the
              diagnosis of ADHD in adults. Our results stress the viability and
              importance of identification of female subjects with ADHD. The

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The scientific literature about attention-deficit
              hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is based almost exclusively on male
              subjects, and girls with ADHD may be underidentified and
              undertreated. The aim of this study was to examine clinical
              correlates of ADHD in females using comprehensive assessments in
              multiple domains of functioning. METHOD: Subjects were 140 girls
              with ADHD and 122 comparison girls without ADHD ascertained from
              pediatric and psychiatric referral sources of the same age and
              social class. Subjects were assessed with structured diagnostic
              interviews, psychometric tests assessing intellectual functioning
              and academic achievement, as well as standardized assessments of
              interpersonal, school, and family functioning by raters who were
              blind to clinical diagnosis. RESULTS: Compared with female
              controls, girls with ADHD were more likely to have conduct, mood,
              and anxiety disorders; lower IQ and achievement scores; and more
              impairment on measures of social, school, and family functioning.
              CONCLUSIONS: These results extend to girls previous findings in
              boys indicating that ADHD is characterized by prototypical core
              symptoms of the disorder, high levels of comorbid
              psychopathology, and dysfunction in multiple domains. These
              results not only support findings documenting phenotypic
              similarities between the genders but also stress the severity of
              the disorder in females.",

  abstract = "Many children have problems in school because of academic
              deficiencies, attentional dysfunction, and poor motor
              coordination. This is perhaps the most common set of problems
              addressed by childhood practitioners in the areas of behavioral
              and developmental pediatrics. Once it was common to refer these
              children to specialists, but this has changed due to the number
              of requests for evaluations and the movement away from specialty
              referrals under some managed care health plans. There is clearly
              a comorbidity between neurodevelopmental disabilities. This
              overlap can go undetected if the general physician does not
              consider the possibility of additional developmental challenges
              when confronted with any one developmental problem. This is
              particularly true when the problem is motor delay, because many
              practitioners and schools minimize the effect that such a delay
              can have on children. Clinical research demonstrates that
              clumsiness can affect a child significantly in multiple arenas.
              At school, problems with coordination and motor speed interfere
              with the child's ability to keep up with his or her peers. Some
              clumsy children are often considered by their peers to be
              ``retarded,'' when in most cases, they are actually quite bright
              although they are unable to perform many everyday tasks and
              activities. This article discusses the association of motor
              disorders with other disorders of attention and learning. Because
              of this association, the primary care physician often must
              address the possibility of motor clumsiness when evaluating the
              child with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).",

              to compromise inter-professional communication and interpretation
              of research. The aim of this study was to determine how the three

              terms were familiar/acceptable to the respondents; and (2) to

              comparison children without motor problems on standardized tests
              of motor function participated in this study. Results revealed
              that both children with DCD and children suspect for DCD obtained
              significantly poorer scores on measures of attention and learning
              (reading, writing and spelling) than comparison children.
              Children with DCD and those suspect for DCD were also found to
              evidence a relatively high level of social problems and display a
              relatively high level of somatic complaints based on parent
              report. These findings indicate that all children with movement
              problems are at risk for problems in attention, learning and
              psychosocial adjustment. Assessment of children with movement
              problems, regardless of the degree or severity of these problems
              should examine a wide range of functions in addition to motor
              functioning. Such an approach, would assist in determining the
              types of intervention that would provide the most benefit to
              these children.",

              however, a characteristic of most psychiatric disorders. It is

              origins and be qualitatively different from the ADHD
              Hyperactive/Impulsive subtype. At the neurobiological level, ADHD
              symptoms may to a large extent be caused by a dysfunctioning
              dopamine system: A dysfunctioning meso-limbo-cortical dopamine
              branch will produce altered reinforcement and extinction
              processes, on a behavioural level giving rise to deficient
              sustained attention, hyperactivity, motor and cognitive
              impulsiveness. A dysfunctioning nigro-striatal dopamine branch
              will cause `extrapyramidal' symptoms. Our model disentangles the
              behaviours usually explained by `executive functions' into
              cognitive impulsiveness, motor impulsiveness and deficient motor
              control. The various dopaminergic branches may not be equally
              dysfunctional in all individuals with ADHD. Etiologically,
              dopamine dysfunctioning will probably mainly be genetically
              determined while sometimes be induced by environmental factors

              screening a general population sample of 1317 five- to
              six-year-old children, four groups of children were selected. The

              exhibiting all ADHD symptoms but without disruptions on two
              situations), 113 children later diagnosed with other
              psychopathology, and 126 healthy controls on computerised motor
              control tasks involving low- and high-level controlled
              processing. In addition, motor control was compared with movement
              speed. Results: The children at risk of ADHD were in general less
              accurate and more variable in their movements than the children
              with other psychopathology and healthy controls. Under conditions
              of high-level controlled processing, the children at risk of ADHD
              were disproportionately more inaccurate and had a more unstable
              performance with their preferred hand than the other children. In
              addition, linear effects were found, with the children at risk of
              ADHD having the worst performance, followed by the children with
              ?borderline ADHD?, and then both groups of control children. No
              significant group differences were found in movement speed.
              Conclusions: The main findings are interpreted as evidence for a
              specific deficit in high-level controlled processing in young
              children at risk of ADHD, now found in a motor task, rather than
              a response task. Furthermore, the results support the notion that
              ADHD represents a dimensional trait. In addition, problems in
              movement control (the need to allocate attentional capacity)
              rather than problems in movement speed distinguish children at
              risk of ADHD from other children. The findings are interpreted as
              evidence that higher-order executive processes, such as
              self-control and self-regulation, are already affected early in

  abstract = "This paper considers Therapeutic Eurythmy (TE) as a possible
              therapy for children with attention deficit hyperactivity
              disorder (ADHD). ADHD manifests as a complex psychological
              disturbance in which deficit of attention such as forgetfulness
              or distraction is the main symptom. It would seem that a growing
              number of children seem to be affected by this syndrome and an
              increasing number of alternative approaches to treatment are
              being sought. Therapeutic Eurythmy is a movement Therapy in the
              context of anthroposophical medicine. As a holistic therapy TE
              affects both physical and spiritual aspects of illness. TE
              entails the practice of movement exercises learned from a trained
              therapist. In this exploratory study, the effects of TE on
              behavioural functioning were examined. This paper addresses five
              single cases where the therapy induced positive changes to
              client's attention span, concentration, tempo of work and motor
              skills such as coordination, dexterity and social behaviour.
              Standard psychological tests parameters for movement, and for
              attention were used to assess aspects of performance. A positive
              shift was observed with reference to concentration and
              development of movement skills. Results were less pronounced but
              showed positive improvements on working speed and social
              behaviour problems. Hyperactivity also diminished to some extent.
              Generally, children were considered to be more mature in their
              development after therapy. The results of these case studies
              suggest that TE may be helpful for children with ADHD. However,
              more systematic research is warranted.",

              the mechanisms that are responsible for the high level of
              comorbidity. In a series of studies, we have investigated the
              link between sensory-motor deficits and developmental disorders.
              Poor sensory-motor integration has long been implicated as a
              cause of motor problems in developmental disorders such as
              developmental coordination disorder (DCD), and our recent

               Attention and impulse control were measured with the Gordon

              First, this study explores clinician reservations about the

               function plays a pivotal role by failing to modulate
               nondopaminergic (primarily glutamate and gaba) signal
               transmission appropriately. a hypofunctioning mesolimbic
               dopamine branch produces altered reinforcement of behavior and
               deficient extinction of previously reinforced behavior. this
               gives rise to delay aversion, development of hyperactivity in
               novel situations, impulsiveness, deficient sustained attention,
               increased behavioral variability, and failure to ``inhibit''
               responses (``disinhibition'').a hypofunctioning mesocortical
               dopamine branch will cause attention response deficiencies
               (deficient orienting responses, impaired saccadic eye movements,
               and poorer attention responses toward a target) and poor
               behavioral planning (poor executive functions). a
               hypofunctioning nigrostriatal dopamine branch will cause
               impaired modulation of motor functions and deficient
               nondeclarative habit learning and memory. these impairments will
               give rise to apparent developmental delay, clumsiness,
               neurological ``soft signs,'' and a ``failure to inhibit''
               responses when quick reactions are required.hypofunctioning
               dopamine branches represent the main individual predispositions
               in the present theory. the theory predicts that behavior and
               symptoms in adhd result from the interplay between individual
               predispositions and the surroundings. the exact adhd symptoms at
               a particular time in life will vary and be influenced by factors

               dysfunction and reduce the special needs of these children. the

              performance and attention scores were significantly better with
              methylphenidate than without it (p<0.001 for improvement in the

              online continuous performance test scores). The findings suggest
              that methylphenidate improves both attention and motor
              coordination in children with coexisting DCD and ADHD. More
              research is needed to disentangle the causality of the
              improvement effect and whether improvement in motor coordination
              is directly affected by methylphenidate or mediated by
              improvement in attention.",

              electrophysiological activation of WM-related neural networks in
              ADHD. To address this issue, we carried out an
              electroencephalographic (EEG) activation study associated with
              time-frequency (TF) analysis in 15 adults with ADHD and 15
              controls performing two visual N-back WM tasks, as well as
              oddball detection and passive fixation tasks. Frontal transient
              (phasic) theta event-related synchronization (ERS, 0-500 msec)
              was significantly reduced in ADHD as compared to control
              subjects. Such reduction was equally present in a
              task-independent manner. In contrast, the power of the later
              sustained (∼500-1200 msec) theta ERS for all tasks was comparable
              in ADHD and control groups. In active WM tasks, ADHD patients
              displayed lower alpha event-related desynchronization (ERD,
              ∼200-900 msec) and higher subsequent alpha ERS (∼900-2400 msec)
              compared to controls. The time course of alpha ERD/ERS cycle was
              modified in ADHD patients compared to controls, suggesting that
              they are able to use late compensatory mechanisms in order to
              perform this WM task. These findings support the idea of an
              ADHD-related dysfunction of neural generators sub-serving
              attention directed to the incoming visual information. ADHD cases
              may successfully face WM needs depending on the preservation of
              sustained theta ERS and prolonged increase of alpha ERS at later
              post-stimulus time points.",

              individual optimal dosing or tested the effects for longer than 4
              weeks. METHOD: One hundred and twenty two drug-free children aged
              7-15 with hyperkinetic disorder and IQ 30-69 were recruited to a
              double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that randomized

              referral source and IQ level in a one to one ratio.
              Methylphenidate was compared with placebo. Dose titration
              comprised at least 1 week each of low (0.5 mg/kg/day), medium
              (1.0 mg/kg/day) and high dose (1.5 mg/kg/day). Parent and teacher
              Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) index of the
              Conners Rating Scale-Short Version at 16 weeks provided the
              primary outcome measures. Clinical response was determined with
              the Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI-I). Adverse effects
              were evaluated by a parent-rated questionnaire, weight, pulse and
              blood pressure. Analyses were by intention to treat. TRIAL
              REGISTRATION: ISRCTN 68384912. RESULTS: Methylphenidate was
              superior to placebo with effect sizes of 0.39 [95\% confidence
              intervals (CIs) 0.09, 0.70] and 0.52 (95\% CIs 0.23, 0.82) for

              a 6-month-weight management program. Twenty-nine obese children
              aged 6-14 years were examined posturographically before and after
              participation in weight management program. The interactive
              balance system evaluated the stability index, Fourier spectral
              analysis, weight distribution index, and falling index. The
              performance was evaluated for eight positions requiring closure
              of eyes, standing on pillows, as well as head turns.
              Anthropometric measurements (e.g., weight, height, BMI, and BMI
              percentiles) were also determined before and after the
              intervention. We found significant increase in height and
              significant decreased in BMI percentile following the
              intervention program (p<.05). Pre-intervention BMI percentile was
              found to be correlated with stability index in most of the
              positions measured (e.g., normal open position=.464; p=.011).
              Following the intervention program, an interaction was found
              between BMI percentile differences (pre- versus
              post-interventional) and balance (stability index and F2-F4
              frequencies of most standing positions). Furthermore, a
              correlation was found between general stability and the falling
              index (.446; p=.015). Regression analysis showed that only
              initial weight distribution index and post-intervention BMI
              entered the equation as predictors of post-intervention weight
              distribution index. CONCLUSION: Weight management program for
              childhood obesity improved stability, reduced potential
              vestibular stress/disturbances, and decreased falling probability
              of the participants. Further longitudinal studies are needed to
              verify the relationship between physical activity, weight loss,
              and reduction of subsequent injuries in obese children.",

              explored the effect of visual tasks on postural control in thirty
              dyslexic children. A selected group of thirty chronological
              age-matched non-dyslexic children (mean age: 9.92 $\pm$ 0.35
              years) and a group of thirty reading age-matched non-dyslexic
              children (mean reading age: 7.90 $\pm$ 0.25 years) were chosen
              for comparison. All children underwent ophthalmologic and
              optometric evaluation. Eye movements were recorded by a
              video-oculography system (EyeBrain\textregistered{} T2) and
              postural sway was recorded simultaneously by a force platform
              (TechnoConept\textregistered{}). All children performed
              fixations, pursuits, pro- and anti-saccades tasks. Dyslexic
              children showed significantly poor near fusional vergence ranges
              (convergence and divergence) with respect to the non-dyslexic
              children groups. During the postural task, quality of fixation
              and anti-saccade performance in dyslexic children were
              significantly worse compared to the two non-dyslexic children
              groups. In contrast, the number of catch-up saccades during
              pursuits and the latency of pro- and anti-saccades were similar
              in the three groups of children examined. Concerning postural
              quality, dyslexic children were more unstable than chronological
              age-matched non-dyslexic children group. For all three groups of
              children tested we also observed that executing saccades (pro-
              and anti-saccades) reduced postural values significantly in
              comparison with fixation and pursuit tasks. The impairment in
              convergence and divergence fusional capabilities could be due to
              an immaturity in cortical structures controlling the vergence
              system. The poor oculomotor performance reported in dyslexic
              children suggested a deficit in allocating visual attention and
              their postural instability observed is in line with the
              cerebellar impairment previously reported in dyslexic children.
              Finally, pro- or anti-saccades reduce postural values compared to
              fixation and pursuit tasks in all groups of children tested,
              suggesting a different influence of visual tasks on postural
              control according to their attentional demand.",

              design in NF research based on regulation performance during
              treatment sessions and self-assessment of the participants.
              Twenty healthy adults participated in 16 sessions of SCPs
              training: 9 participants received regular SCP training, 11
              participants received sham feedback. At three time points (pre,
              intermediate, post) fMRI and EEG/ERP-measurements were conducted
              during a continuous performance test (CPT). Performance-data
              during the sessions (regulation performance) in the treatment
              group and the placebo group were analyzed. Analysis of
              EEG-activity revealed in the SCP group a strong enhancement of
              the CNV (electrode Cz) at the intermediate assessment, followed
              by a decrease back to baseline at the post-treatment assessment.
              In contrast, in the placebo group a continuous but smaller
              increase of the CNV could be obtained from pre to post
              assessment. The increase of the CNV in the SCP group at
              intermediate testing was superior to the enhancement in the
              placebo group. The changes of the CNV were accompanied by a
              continuous improvement in the test performance of the CPT from
              pre to intermediate to post assessment comparable in both groups.
              The change of the CNV in the SCP group is interpreted as an
              indicator of neural plasticity and efficiency while an increase
              of the CNV in the placebo group might reflect learning and
              improved timing due to the frequent task repetition. In the fMRI
              analysis evidence was obtained for neuronal plasticity. After
              regular SCP neurofeedback activation in the posterior parietal
              cortex decreased from the pre- to the intermediate measurement
              and increased again in the post measurement, inversely following
              the U-shaped increase and decrease of the tCNV EEG amplitude in
              the SCP-trained group. Furthermore, we found a localized increase
              of activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Analyses of
              the estimation of treatment assignment by the participants
              indicate feasibility of blinding. Participants could not assess
              treatment assignment confidently. Participants of the SCP-group
              improved regulation capability during treatment sessions (in
              contrast to the participants of the placebo-group), although
              regulation capability appeared to be instable, presumably due to
              diminished confidence in the training (SCP- or sham-training).
              Our results indicate that SCP training in healthy adults might
              lead to functional changes in neuronal circuits serving cognitive
              preparation even after a limited number of sessions.",

              article, a methodological framework is summarised considering the
              training as a neuro-behavioural treatment. Randomised controlled
              trials are selectively reviewed. Results from two smaller-scale
              studies are presented with the first study comprising a
              tomographic analysis over the course of a slow cortical potential
              (SCP) training and a correlational analysis of regulation skills
              and clinical outcome in children with ADHD. In the second study,
              ADHD-related behaviour was studied in children with tic disorder
              who either conducted a SCP training or a theta/low-beta (12-15
              Hz) training (single-blind, randomised design). Both studies
              provide further evidence for the specificity of NF effects in
              ADHD. Based on these findings, a refined model of the mechanisms
              contributing to the efficacy of SCP training is developed.
              Despite a number of open questions concerning core mechanisms,
              moderators and mediators, NF (theta/beta and SCP) training seems
              to be on its way to become a valuable and ethically acceptable

              (ADHD) and if stimulant medication improved performance when both
              disorders were present. METHODS: The sample consisted of
              thirty-three children with an identified oral language disorder
              (of which 22 had comorbid ADHD) ages 6 to 13 who were enrolled in
              a yearlong intensive learning intervention program. Those on a

              later on and off medication. RESULTS: Objective measures that
              included an infrared motion analysis system which tracked and
              recorded subtle movements discriminated children with OLD from
              those with a comorbid ADHD disorder whereas classic attention

              objective diagnostic differential for OLD and ADHD and provides
              quantifiable changes in performance related to medication for

              dysfunctions of higher levels of cognitive and motor integration.
              According to our knowledge, there are only a few studies
              suggesting that balance deficits are related to behavioral
              disturbances in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
              METHODS: We tested the extent to which balance deficits were
              related to ADHD symptoms in 35 medication-na{\"\i}ve boys of
              school age (8-11 years) and compared the results with a control

              literature for a direct relationship between ADHD symptoms and
              balance deficits, that cannot be attributed to medication and the

              increased postural sway, are commonly reported in children with
              ADHD, but have yet to be investigated in adults with ADHD.
              Furthermore, although these abnormalities are thought to stem
              from cerebellar deficits, evidence for an association between the
              cerebellum and these motor deficits has yet to be provided for
              either adults or children with ADHD. METHOD: In this study, we
              measured postural sway in adults with ADHD and controls,
              examining the relationship between sway and regional cerebellar
              gray matter volume. Thirty-two ADHD and 28 control participants
              completed various standing-posture tasks on a Wii balance board.
              RESULTS: Postural sway was significantly higher for the ADHD
              group compared to the healthy controls. Higher sway was
              positively associated with regional gray matter volume in the
              right posterior cerebellum (lobule VIII/IX). CONCLUSION: These
              findings show that sway abnormalities commonly reported in
              children with ADHD are also present in adults, and for the first

              with TS (9 boys and 3 girls; 9.4$\pm$1.1yr) and 12 HC age- and
              gender-matched children (9.2$\pm$1.1yr) participated in this
              study. The Sensory Organization Test (SOT) was used to assess
              postural stability under six altered sensory conditions (1.
              normal vision, fixed support; 2. eyes closed, fixed support; 3.
              vision sway-referenced, fixed support; 4. normal vision, support

              areas, especially in the treatment of children with
              attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This study
              protocol is designed to investigate the effect of slow cortical
              potential (SCP) feedback and a new form of neurofeedback using
              near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) on symptomatology and
              neurophysiological parameters in an adult ADHD population. A
              comparison of SCP and NIRS feedback therapy methods has not been
              previously conducted and may yield valuable findings about
              alternative treatments for adult ADHD. METHODS/DESIGN: The
              outcome of both neurofeedback techniques will be assessed over 30
              treatment sessions and after a 6-month follow-up period, and then
              will be compared to a nonspecific biofeedback treatment.
              Furthermore, to investigate if treatment effects in this
              proof-of-principle study can be predicted by specific
              neurophysiological baseline parameters, regression models will be
              applied. Finally, a comparison with healthy controls will be
              conducted to evaluate deviant pretraining neurophysiological
              parameters, stability of assessment measures, and treatment
              outcome. DISCUSSION: To date, an investigation and comparison of
              SCP and NIRS feedback training to an active control has not been
              conducted; therefore, we hope to gain valuable insights in

              start by reviewing various aspects of motor abnormalities found
              in ADHD and related brain mechanisms. Then, we classify reported
              motor impairments associated with ADHD, into four classes of
              motor stages: Attention to the task, motion preparation, motion
              execution and motion monitoring. Motor abnormalities and
              corresponding neural activations are analyzed in the context of
              each of the four identified motor patterns, along with the
              interactions among them and with other systems. Given the
              specifications and models of the role of the four motor
              impairments in ADHD, we ask what treatments correspond to the
              identified motor impairments. We analyze therapeutic
              interventions targeting motor difficulties most commonly
              experienced among individuals with ADHD; first, Neurofeedback
              training and EMG-biofeedback. As some of the identified
              components of attention, planning and monitoring have been shown
              to be linked to abnormal oscillation patterns in the brain, we
              examine neurofeedback interventions aimed to address these types
              of oscillations: Theta/beta frequency training and SCP
              neurofeedback targeted at elevating the CNV component.
              Additionally we discuss EMG-Biofeedback interventions targeted at
              feedback on motor activity. Further we review physical activity
              and motor interventions aimed at improving motor difficulties,
              associated with ADHD. These kinds of interventions are shown to
              be helpful not only in aspects of physical ability, but also in
              enhancing cognition and executive functioning.",

  abstract = "Little is known about the causes of individual differences in
              reward sensitivity. We investigated gene-environment interactions
              (GxE) on behavioral and neural measures of reward sensitivity, in
              light of the differential susceptibility theory. This theory
              states that individuals carrying plasticity gene variants will be
              more disadvantaged in negative, but more advantaged in positive
              environments. Reward responses were assessed during a monetary
              incentive delay task in 178 participants with and 265 without
              attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), from N=261
              families. We examined interactions between variants in candidate
              plasticity genes (DAT1, 5-HTT and DRD4) and social environments
              (maternal expressed emotion and peer affiliation). HTTLPR short
              allele carriers showed the least reward speeding when exposed to
              high positive peer affiliation, but the most when faced with low
              positive peer affiliation or low maternal warmth. DAT1 10-repeat
              homozygotes displayed similar GxE patterns toward maternal warmth
              on general task performance. At the neural level, DRD4 7-repeat
              carriers showed the least striatal activation during reward
              anticipation when exposed to high maternal warmth, but the most
              when exposed to low warmth. Findings were independent of ADHD
              severity. Our results partially confirm the differential
              susceptibility theory and indicate the importance of positive
              social environments in reward sensitivity and general task
              performance for persons with specific genotypes.",
