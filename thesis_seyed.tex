\begin{abstract}
Seated locomotor tasks such as cycling or recumbent stepping improve walking performance during rehabilitation. Cortical control during walking is most pronounced when the person is perturbed. But, the electrocortical dynamics during perturbed seated tasks has not been studied in detail. The primary purpose of this research was to quantify cortical and muscular responses to mechanical perturbations during recumbent stepping. We also aimed to quantify possible differences between young and older adults' responses to perturbed stepping. Seventeen young adults and eleven older adutls completed four perturbed arms and leg stepping tasks. We perturbed the stepping with brief 200ms increased movement resistance using a controllable serovmotr on our recumbent stepper. We asked subjects to step smoothly, use both arms and legs and follow the visual pacing cue set at 60 steps per minute. We used high-density electroencephalogrphy (EEG) with 128 electrodes to record brain activity, 16 electromyography (EMG) sensors to record muscle actvitty, and stepping kinematics using the servomotor's encoder.
